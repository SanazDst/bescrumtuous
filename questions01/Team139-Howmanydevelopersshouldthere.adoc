[#explanation]
--
A Scrum Team should have 10 or less members, which includes the Scrum Master and Product Owner. That leaves room for 8 developers.

"The Scrum Team is small enough to remain nimble and large enough to complete significant work within a Sprint, typically 10 or fewer people. In general, we have found that smaller teams communicate better and are more productive." -The Scrum Guide, page 5
