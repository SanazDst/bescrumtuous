The are no rules in the Scrum Guide about where or when the daily Scrum takes place. The only rule is that is must take place at the same time and in the same place every day. If developers find it productive to do their Daily Scrum on the Whitehouse lawn, then let them, so long as it doesn't impede their ability to complete their Sprint Goals.

From the Scrum Guide: "The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute event for the Developers of the Scrum Team. To reduce complexity, it is held at the same time and place every working day of the Sprint."
