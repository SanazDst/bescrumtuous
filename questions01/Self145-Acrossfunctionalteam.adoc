A cross functional team in the software development domain will possess the skills to build and test components from end-to-end.

A Scrum Team will not outsource Product Backlot items to an external third-party, and responsibilities like user acceptance testing, quality assurance and are done within the team. These tasks are not assigned to sub-teams or external teams. 

The Scrum has the ability to implement Product backlog items from end-to-end. 

"Scrum Teams are cross-functional, meaning the members have all the skills necessary to create value each Sprint." -The Scrum Guide, page 5
