[#explanation]

The Product Owner develops, orders and communicates backlog items to the rest of the team. Note that in this sense 'development' does not mean software development, but instead developing the description of the Product Backlog item.

Estimating Product Backlog Items and choosing which ones go into a Sprint is the job of the developers.

"The Product Owner is also accountable for effective Product Backlog management, which includes:

Developing and explicitly communicating the Product Goal;
Creating and clearly communicating Product Backlog items;
Ordering Product Backlog items; and,
Ensuring that the Product Backlog is transparent, visible and understood."
