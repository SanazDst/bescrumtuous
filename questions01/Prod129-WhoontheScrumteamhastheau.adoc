The Scrum guide states:



Developers are always accountable for:

- Creating a plan for the Sprint, the Sprint Backlog;

- Instilling quality by adhering to a Definition of Done;

- Adapting their plan each day toward the Sprint Goal; and,

- Holding each other accountable as professionals.



Remember, the Product Owner is responsible for the Product Backlog, not the Sprint Backlog.
