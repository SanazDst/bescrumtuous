The Definition of Done is the criteria used to test of an Product Backlog item is completed. A completed Product Backlog item creates an Increment. So the Definition of Done is what creates focus for an Increment.

"Each artifact contains a commitment to ensure it provides information that enhances transparency and focus against which progress can be measured:

- For the Product Backlog it is the Product Goal.

- For the Sprint Backlog it is the Sprint Goal.

- For the Increment it is the Definition of Done."
