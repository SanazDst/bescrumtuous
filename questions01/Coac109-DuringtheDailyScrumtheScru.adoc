According to the Scrum Guide, "the Daily Scrum is a 15-minute event for the Developers of the Scrum Team." There isn't even a requirement that the Scrum Master attend!

One rule of the Scrum Guide is that the Daily Scrum stays under 15 minutes. If the Scrum Master realizes that the meetings are going on longer, this becomes a teachable and coachable event.
