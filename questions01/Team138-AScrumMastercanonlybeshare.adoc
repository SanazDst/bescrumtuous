This is false.

A Scrum Master can be shared across many teams. There is nothing in the Scrum Guide that says a Scrum Master can only work with one team, or on one product at a time.

Having said that, the availability and participation of a Scrum Master plays a big part in the success of Scrum. A Scum Master should never be spread so thin that they cannot effectively do their job.
