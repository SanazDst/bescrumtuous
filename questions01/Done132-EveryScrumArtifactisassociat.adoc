An Increment is created when a Backlog Item meets the Definition of Done. The Definition of Done is the commitment associated with Increment.

"Each artifact contains a commitment to ensure it provides information that enhances transparency and focus against which progress can be measured:

For the Product Backlog it is the Product Goal.
For the Sprint Backlog it is the Sprint Goal.
For the Increment it is the Definition of Done." -The Scrum Guide, page 10
