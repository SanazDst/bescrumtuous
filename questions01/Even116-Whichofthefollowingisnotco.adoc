Every Scrum event is considered to be part of the Sprint. That includes the Daily Scrum, the Sprint Retrospective, Sprint Planning and the Sprint Review.

Scrum does not have a Daily Standup. The term is ableist and is discouraged. In Scrum, you have a Daily Scrum, not a Standup.

"The Sprint is a container for all other events... A new Sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous Sprint." - The Scrum Guide
