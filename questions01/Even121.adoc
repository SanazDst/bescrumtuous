All of the Scrum events occur within the Sprint.

A new Sprint begins immediately after the old Sprint ends.

Technically speaking, the end of the Sprint Retrospective marks the end of the current Sprint, so this answer is correct as well.

"Scrum combines four formal events for inspection and adaptation within a containing event, the Sprint." -TSG, page 3
