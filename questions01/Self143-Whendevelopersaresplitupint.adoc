When building a Scrum Team we do not worry about team leads, or testers or SMEs (Subject Matter Experts). What matters is the teams have the skills necessary to complete the project.

If a team doesn't have the combined skills to achieve the Definition of Done, what point is there having them work on a Backlog Item?
