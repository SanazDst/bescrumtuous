[#explanation]

The Sprint Goal is created during the Sprint Planning meeting. Before Sprint Planning concludes, the team must have a Sprint Goal to drive the project.According to page 8 of the Scrum Guide, "The Product Owner proposes how the product could increase its value and utility in the current Sprint. The whole Scrum Team then collaborates to define a Sprint Goal that communicates why the Sprint is valuable to stakeholders. The Sprint Goal must be finalized prior to the end of Sprint Planning."
