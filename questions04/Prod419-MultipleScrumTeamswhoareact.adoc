When multiple teams work on the same project, they will have a common Product Backlog and a common Product Owner. However, they will maintain a separate Sprint Backlog because each team will be working on different things at the same time."If Scrum Teams become too large, they should consider reorganizing into multiple cohesive Scrum Teams, each focused on the same product. Therefore, they should share the same Product Goal, Product Backlog, and Product Owner." -The Scrum Guide, page 5
