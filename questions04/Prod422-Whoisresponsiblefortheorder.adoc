Only the Product Owner can order the Backlot Items.Note that there is no 'Project Manager' in Scrum. Any time this appears on a Scrum Master certification exam question, it is likely to be wrong."The Product Owner is also accountable for effective Product Backlog management, which includes:Developing and explicitly communicating the Product Goal;
Creating and clearly communicating Product Backlog items;
Ordering Product Backlog items; and,
Ensuring that the Product Backlog is transparent, visible and understood." -TSG, page 6
