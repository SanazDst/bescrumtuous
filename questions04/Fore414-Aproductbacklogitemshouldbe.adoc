When decomposing a backlog item, the goal is to break the backlog item down into a unit of work that can be completed in one day or less."For each selected Product Backlog item, the Developers plan the work necessary to create an Increment that meets the Definition of Done. This is often done by decomposing Product Backlog items into smaller work items of one day or less."
