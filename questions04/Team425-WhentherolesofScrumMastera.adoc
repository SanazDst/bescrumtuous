B

[#explanation]

This is false. False, false, false, false, false.

Don't ever fall for the myth that Scrum is a project management methodology. It is not.No Scrum role replaces the need for a Project Manager.And no combination of Scrum Roles add up to the job a Project Manager performs.Scrum and Project Management are two very different and separate job functions. Any question or option that infers otherwise is just plain wrong.
