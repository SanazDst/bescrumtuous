[#answer]
B

[#explanation]

This is false.The term 'Team Lead' is not used at all in the Scrum Guide, so any reference to a 'Team Lead' in the Scrum Guide is likely a red herring to be avoided.Secondly, the Scrum Master is not even required to attend the Daily Scrum, so that part of the question is wrong as well.The developers are self-managed. They decide on their own how to start the Daily Scrum.
