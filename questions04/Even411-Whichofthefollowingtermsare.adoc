Scrum does not have a 'Daily Stand-up.' It has a Daily Scrum. The term Daily Stand-up has many connotations that are not in line with Scrum values so the term should be avoided.The Definition of Done is an important concept of Scrum.Ken Schwaber is one of the authors of the Scrum Guide.Creative Commons is how the Scrum Guide is licensed.
