There is no break after a Sprint. All of the Sprint Events happen within the Sprint, so when one Sprint completes, a new Sprint immediately begins.

"They are fixed length events of one month or less to create consistency. A new Sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous Sprint." -The Scrum Guide
