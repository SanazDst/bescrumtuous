The Sprint Goal, not Scrum Goal,  is intended to keep developers more focused throughout the Sprint."Each artifact contains a commitment to ensure it provides information that enhances transparency and focus against which progress can be measured:? For the Product Backlog it is the Product Goal.? For the Sprint Backlog it is the Sprint Goal.? For the Increment it is the Definition of Done."-The Scrum Guide, page 10
