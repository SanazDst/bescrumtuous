[#answer]
D

[#explanation]

Scrum does not grant any of its members to fire another member.

A development team can choose have a developer removed from the team. But this is not the same as firing a developer.

If a development team chooses to remove a member, that is the right they have as a self-organizing team. Whether a company fires that developer, or allocates them to a different team, is not a concern of the Scrum team.
