Whenever developers identify new work that must be added to the backlog, it should be added to the backlog.When new work is identified, and that work is required to meet the Sprint Goal, a Scrum Developer shouldn't wait for the Daily Scrum or some other official Scrum Event to add that work to the backlog."The Daily Scrum is not the only time Developers are allowed to adjust their plan. They often meet throughout the day for more detailed discussions about adapting or re-planning the rest of the Sprint?s work."
