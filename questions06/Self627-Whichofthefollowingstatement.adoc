According to the Scrum Guide, Scrum Teams are both cross-functional and self-managing."Scrum Teams are cross-functional, meaning the members have all the skills necessary to create value each Sprint. They are also self-managing, meaning they internally decide who does what, when, and how." -The Scrum Guide, page 5
