When it comes to how much effort the team puts into a Product Backlog item, the two key concepts are working at a sustainable pace, and meeting the Definition of Done.

"Working in Sprints at a sustainable pace improves the Scrum Teamâ€™s focus and consistency."
-The Scrum Guide.

When a Development Team selects a Product Backlog item for a Sprint, they need to determine how much work they can commit to completing during that Sprint. The amount of work the team commits to is based on their capacity and their understanding of the requirements of the selected item. The team considers various factors such as their velocity, capacity and any dependencies or risks associated with the item. They then commit to completing the work that they believe is achievable in the upcoming Sprint.

The concept of the "Definition of Done" is also closely related to the amount of work the developers commit to during a Sprint. The "Definition of Done" is a shared understanding among the team of the criteria that must be met for a Product Backlog item to be considered complete. The Definition of Done typically includes criteria related to functionality, quality and usability, among other things.
