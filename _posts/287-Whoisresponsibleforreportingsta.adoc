[.list]
* [ ] A. The Product Owner.

[.answer]
D

[.explanation]
The Daily Scrum is not a status update and nowhere in the Scrum Guide does it suggest that what happens in the Daily Scrum should be reported to stakeholders.

It is a time for developers to adapt to changes and make changes to the Sprint Backlog if it is necessary to keep the Sprint Goal in focus.
