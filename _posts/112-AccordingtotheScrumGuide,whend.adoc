[.explanation]
A Sprint Retrospective is the last Scrum Event to take place in the Sprint. It takes place after the Sprint Review.


"The Sprint Retrospective concludes the Sprint. It is timeboxed to a maximum of three hours for a one-month Sprint. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter."
