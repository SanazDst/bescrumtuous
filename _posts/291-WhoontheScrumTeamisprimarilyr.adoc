[.answer]
E

[.explanation]
In the Scrum framework, the Product Owner is primarily responsible for engaging with stakeholders and C-suite executives. The Product Owner represents the stakeholders and is responsible for maximizing the value of the product or service that the Development Team is building. This involves managing the Product Backlog, which is a prioritized list of the work that the Development Team will complete during the upcoming Sprints.

As part of their role, the Product Owner engages with stakeholders and C-suite executives to understand their needs, gather feedback, and communicate the progress and status of the product development effort. This includes working with stakeholders to define the product vision, goals, and requirements, as well as gathering and prioritizing feedback on the product throughout the development process.

The Product Owner also works closely with the Development Team to ensure that the work being done is aligned with stakeholder needs and priorities. They provide guidance on the direction of the product and make decisions on behalf of the stakeholders regarding the prioritization of work in the Product Backlog.

While the Scrum Master and the Development Team may also interact with stakeholders and C-suite executives from time to time, it is the Product Owner who is primarily responsible for these activities. They are the ones who have the most direct contact with stakeholders and are the key point of communication between the Development Team and the outside world.****
