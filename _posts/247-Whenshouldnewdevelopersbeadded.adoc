[.answer]
C

[.explanation]
A new developer can be added to a project at any point in time. There is no rule barring a developer from joining a Scrum team during Sprint Planning, the Sprint Retrospective or even half-way through a Sprint.

Sustainable development is an important Agile principle. Developers should always be challenged and motivated, but they should never be overworked. If a new developer needs to be added to the team to maintain sustainable developer, then add them. 

Just keep in mind that onboarding will sometimes reduce the team's productivity, as training and orientation for the new hire will likely occupy some of your developer's time.
