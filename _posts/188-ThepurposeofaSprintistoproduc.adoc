This is false. 

The goal of a Sprint is to create an Increment that is additive and usable.

"An Increment is a concrete stepping stone toward the Product Goal. Each Increment is additive to all prior Increments and thoroughly verified, ensuring that all Increments work together. In order to provide value, the Increment must be usable."****
