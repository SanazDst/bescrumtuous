D

[.explanation]
In Scrum, the Product Owner is the only person who has the authority to cancel a sprint. This is because the Product Owner is the one who has the responsibility for maximizing the value of the product and making decisions about what work should be done.

While the development team and the Scrum Master may identify issues that suggest the sprint cannot be completed as planned, they cannot cancel the sprint on their own. This is because the sprint is a commitment that the team has made to complete the work they have planned for the sprint.

The Product Owner may cancel a sprint if they determine that the sprint goal is no longer achievable, or if the market or business circumstances change and completing the sprint work would no longer provide value. The Product Owner should work with the development team and the Scrum Master to understand the impact of canceling the sprint and to determine the best course of action.

It's important to note that canceling a sprint should be a rare occurrence in Scrum, as it disrupts the team's ability to deliver a potentially releasable increment of the product. Cancelling a sprint can also be costly and can undermine the team's confidence and trust in the Scrum framework.

In summary, the Product Owner is the only person who has the authority to cancel a sprint in Scrum because they have the responsibility for making decisions about what work should be done to maximize the value of the product. The development team and the Scrum Master should work with the Product Owner to understand the impact of canceling a sprint and to determine the best course of action.
