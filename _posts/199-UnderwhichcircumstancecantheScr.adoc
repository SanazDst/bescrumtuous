****

[.query]
Under which circumstance can the Scrum Master extend the length of the Sprint once development work has started?

[.list]
* [ ] A. The Sprint can be extended equal to the number of days a Product Owner is absent
* [*] B. The Sprint can be extended equal to the number of holidays that occurred during the Sprint
* [ ] C. The Spring length cannot be changed after it has been started
****

[.answer]
B

[.explanation]
Once a Sprint has started, the Sprint length cannot be changed.

If the team wants to change the length of Sprints that is possible, but doing so should be discussed in a Scrum event, agreed upon by the team, and not arbitrarily decided by the Scrum Master. ****
