The Scrum Guide states that "Developers are always accountable for adapting their plan each day toward achieving the Sprint Goal." That includes keeping track of the work completed, the work that needs to be completed, and renegotiating the scope of the Sprint with the Product Owner as more information about the team's progress is learned during the Sprint.
