According to page 5 of the Scrum Guide, "the entire Scrum Team is accountable for creating a valuable, useful Increment every Sprint."Technically speaking, an increment occurs every time a Product Backlog item meets the Definition of Done. Increments can happen any time throughout a Sprint, but must happen at some time before the Sprint ends.
