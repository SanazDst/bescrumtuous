The Scrum Developers are the ones who estimate the work required to complete a Product Backlog item. But this is done in collaboration with the Product Owner whose job it is to communicate the requirements of the Product Backlog item to the developers.Creation of the Product Goal and communicating that Product Goal to the rest of the team is the job of the Product Owner, not the Scrum Master or developers.
