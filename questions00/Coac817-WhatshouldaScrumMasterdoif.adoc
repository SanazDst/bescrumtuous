The Scrum Developers are expected to have all of the skills required to complete all the Product Backlog items. If those skills do not exist, the developers must acquire them as they work on other Product Backlog items.

It is also possible to adjust the Definition of Done to make the delivery of an increment possible. For example, if the Definition of Done says every product must be testing by flying it to Mars and back, but you don't have a spaceship that can fly to Mars, it wouldn't be unreasonable to remove that requirement from the Definition of Done.

Every Sprint must provide a real, tangible increment of work. There are no 'infrastructure sprints' in Scrum or 'Sprint Zeros.' Every Sprint must have the delivery of an increment of work as its goal.
