When it comes to how much effort the team puts into completing Product Backlog item selected for the Sprint, the two key concepts are:

- Working at a sustainable pace.
- Meeting the Definition of Done.

"Working in Sprints at a sustainable pace improves the Scrum Teamâ€™s focus and consistency."
-The Scrum Guide.

When a Development Team selects a Product Backlog item for a Sprint, they need to determine how much work they can commit to completing during that Sprint. The amount of work the team commits to is based on their understanding of their own capacity along with their understanding of how much effort is required to meet the agreed upon Definition of Done.

The concept of the Definition of Done is very closely related to the amount of work the developers commit to during a Sprint. The Definition of Done is a shared understanding among the team of the criteria that must be met for a Product Backlog item to be considered complete. 

The Definition of Done typically includes criteria related to functionality, quality and usability, among other things. The Increment is complete when the PBI meets the Definition of Done. If unit testing or QA routines are required for a PBI to be complete, those items must be included in the Definition of Done. They are not tasks that are to be completed _after_ the Definition of Done has been achieved.
