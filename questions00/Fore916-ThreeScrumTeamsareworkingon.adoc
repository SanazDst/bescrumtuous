[#answer]
A

[#explanation]
--
The increments from multiple Scrum Teams working on the same product should be integrated continuously. If they are not integrated continuously, at the very least, they need to be integrated before the Sprint Review. 

If code changes are not integrated, how does anyone know that the changes and updates they made even work?

Multiple Scrum teams working on the same project should continuously integrate their increments of work for several reasons:


- Early detection of integration issues
- Improved transparency
- Teams will collboarate and communicate more often

If something works and meets the definition of done, it should be integrated right away. Waiting makes no sense. Waiting is certainly not in like with Scrum's commitment to lean thinking.
