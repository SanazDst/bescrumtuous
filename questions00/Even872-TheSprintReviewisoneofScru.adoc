C

[#explanation]

The Sprint Review should only last for 4 hours.

You must know the maximum allowed time-box for each event in Scrum:

- 15 minutes for the Daily Scrum
- 3 hours for the Sprint Retrospective
- 4 hours for the Sprint Review
- 8 hours for Sprint Planning
- One calendar month for a Sprint

From the Scrum Guide: "The Sprint Review is the second to last event of the Sprint and is timeboxed to a maximum of four hours for a one-month Sprint. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter."
