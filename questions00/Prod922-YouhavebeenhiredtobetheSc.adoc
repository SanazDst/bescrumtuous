In Scrum, the Product Backlog is the single, ordered list of items that define what needs to be done to complete the project. The Product Owner is responsible for managing the Product Backlog, ensuring that it is constantly refined and ordered, and that the development team has a clear understanding of what needs to be built and why.

When multiple teams are building the same product, they must share:

- A common Product Backlog
- The same Product Owner
- A common Product Goal
- The same Definition of Done
