In Scrum, the Product Backlog is the single, prioritized list of items that define what needs to be done to achieve the project's goal. The Product Owner is responsible for managing the Product Backlog, ensuring that it is constantly refined and prioritized, and that the development team has a clear understanding of what needs to be built and why.

When multiple teams are building the same project, they must share:

- A common Product Backlog
- The same Product Owner
- A common Product Goal
- The same Definition of Done

There are several reasons why the Scrum Guide requires this:

Consistency: By having a common Product Backlog and Product Owner, all teams are working towards the same set of goals and priorities. This ensures that everyone is on the same page and working towards the same objectives.

Collaboration: By sharing a common Product Backlog and Product Owner, teams can collaborate more easily and share information more effectively. They can work together to refine and prioritize the backlog, ensuring that it reflects the needs of all stakeholders.

Alignment: By having a common backlog and Product Owner, the entire organization is more likely to work towards the same objectives.

Efficiency: A common backlog and Product Owner helps to improve the efficiency of the development process. Teams can work together to identify dependencies and plan their work more effectively, avoiding duplication of effort and ensuring that everyone is working on the most important tasks.
