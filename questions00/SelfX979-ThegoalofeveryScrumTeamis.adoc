C

[#explanation]

The Scrum Team should work together, as a whole, to create a product that provides full end-to-end functionality within the requirements of the Product Backlog and the Definition of Done.

There are no sub-teams in Scrum, nor are their leaders or managers. 

"Within a Scrum Team, there are no sub-teams or hierarchies. They are also self-managing, meaning they internally decide who does what, when, and how."
