A Scrum Team is expected to be cross-functional and have all the skills needed to address issues that arise. The team should be able to make independent decisions without consulting external specialists.

A self-managed, cross-functional team is also expected to resolve conflicts on their own. From the Scrum perspective, and certainly on the Scrum Master certification exam, going to Human Resources to resolve a problem is not a prescribed approach. 

The Scrum Guide never once mentions the term "Human Resources,' nor is it even reasonable to assume that every team doing Scrum would have a Human Resources department. Avoid any options on a Scrum Master exam question that references HR.

A Scrum Master _coaches and facilitates_ in order to help the development team come to their own conclusions and find paths to help them move forward.
