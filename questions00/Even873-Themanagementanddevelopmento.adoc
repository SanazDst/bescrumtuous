[#explanation]

Work produced by external teams is not a topic Scrum Developers should focus on during the Daily Scrum. The Scrum Developers should only be focused on their own product-related activities, the Sprint Goal and how they can adapt their current plan to meet the Sprint Goal.

Something created and developed outside the Scrum Team should not be part of their backlog as they have no control over it. 

The Scrum Team is not subject to external management but is instead empowered to self-manage.

From the Scrum Guide: "The Scrum Team is responsible for all product-related activities from stakeholder collaboration, verification, maintenance, operation, experimentation, research and development, and anything else that might be required. They are structured and empowered by the organization to manage their own work."
