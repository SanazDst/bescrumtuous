[#answer]
B

[#explanation]
--
The development team has full control over the Sprint Backlog. Only the development team has the authority to add or remove Sprint Backlog items.

Anyone can discuss the Sprint Backlog with the development team and relay any concerns to them, but it is the development team that has the final say.
