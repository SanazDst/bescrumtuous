All Scrum Events happen with a Sprint. Nothing happens 'outside of a Sprint'.

A Sprint is a timeboxed period of one to four weeks during which the development team works to create a potentially releasable product increment. Within a Sprint, there are several key Scrum events that occur to facilitate the successful completion of the Sprint.

The following are the Scrum events that happen within a Sprint, and why they are important:

Sprint Planning: This is a collaborative meeting where the development team, Scrum Master, and Product Owner work together to identify and prioritize the work that needs to be completed during the upcoming Sprint. The purpose of Sprint Planning is to ensure that everyone is aligned on the Sprint goal and the work that needs to be done to achieve it.

Daily Scrum: This is a brief, timeboxed meeting that occurs daily during the Sprint. The purpose of the Daily Scrum is to provide an opportunity for the development team to synchronize and plan their work for the day. During the Daily Scrum, each team member provides a brief update on their progress, discusses any obstacles they are facing, and identifies any potential risks to the Sprint goal.

Sprint Review: This is a meeting that occurs at the end of the Sprint, where the development team demonstrates the work they have completed to the Product Owner and other stakeholders. The purpose of the Sprint Review is to get feedback on the product increment that has been developed, and to identify any necessary changes or adjustments to the product backlog.

Sprint Retrospective: This is a meeting that occurs at the end of the Sprint, where the development team reflects on their process and identifies opportunities for improvement. The purpose of the Sprint Retrospective is to help the team continuously improve their process and performance.

All of these Scrum events happen within a Sprint to help ensure that the development team is working effectively and efficiently to deliver a high-quality product increment. By having a clearly defined Sprint goal, daily synchronization, regular feedback, and continuous improvement, the development team is able to stay focused and motivated throughout the Sprint, while also ensuring that the product being developed is aligned with the needs of the stakeholders.
