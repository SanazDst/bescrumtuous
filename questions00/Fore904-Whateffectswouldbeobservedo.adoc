A

The original Scrum Team might experience a period of reduced productivity as the teams become accustomed to working together, but over the medium term, the collective productivity of all the teams should return to a normal baseline.

There are several potential reasons why the productivity of a well-functioning Scrum team might decrease when new teams are added to the project:

Forming and Storming: When new teams are added to a project, the teams must go through the "forming" and "storming" stages of group development, where they get to know each other and figure out how to work together effectively. This process can take time and can be disruptive to the original team's productivity.

Communication: Effective communication is essential for multiple Scrum Teams working together to build the same product. When new Teams are added, the original team's communication channels can become disrupted, leading to misunderstandings, delays, and other issues that can impact productivity.

Disruption to processes: Introducing new teams to a product development effort can also disrupt established processes and ways of working, which can lead to confusion and delays.

Adding multiple teams to assist in the development of a product is a significant change, especially if a single team working on the product had established processes and methodologies. Such a change is likely to hurt productivity in the short term, although in the long-term productivity levels should return to normal.
