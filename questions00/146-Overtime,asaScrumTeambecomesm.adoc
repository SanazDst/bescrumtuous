E

[.explanation]
Scrum teams typically develop a more stringent "Definition of Done" (DoD) the longer they work with the Scrum framework for several reasons:

Increased Understanding: As the team gains more experience with Scrum, they begin to understand the importance of having a clear and comprehensive DoD. They begin to see the benefits of ensuring that all work meets a consistent quality standard, which is critical to maintaining the integrity of the product and delivering value to the customer.

Continuous Improvement: Scrum is a framework that emphasizes continuous improvement, and the DoD is a critical aspect of that process. Teams are encouraged to constantly review and refine their DoD to ensure that it reflects the best practices and standards for their product and industry.

Addressing Quality Issues: Over time, the team may encounter quality issues or defects that are caused by incomplete or unclear definitions of "done." By refining the DoD, the team can reduce the risk of these issues and improve the quality of the product.

Encouraging Collaboration: A well-defined DoD helps to promote collaboration and shared understanding within the team. As team members work together to establish and refine the DoD, they gain a deeper appreciation for each other's roles and responsibilities, and develop a more collaborative mindset.

Increased Complexity: As the team begins to tackle more complex work, they will naturally need to develop a more detailed and comprehensive DoD. This is because the work may involve multiple layers of testing, integration, and other quality checks, which require a more rigorous approach to ensure that the work is truly "done."

Overall, developing a more stringent DoD is a natural part of the team's maturation process within the Scrum framework. It reflects a growing understanding of the importance of quality and collaboration, and a commitment to continuous improvement.****
