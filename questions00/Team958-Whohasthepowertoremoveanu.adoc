Development teams in Scrum are self-managed and self-organized.

If the team decides a member is impeding progress, they have the final say over whether the team member be allowed to stay on the team or not.

Note, this doesn't mean the person is fired. It just means this team was not the correct fit. The person may end up being a great performer somewhere else in the organization.
