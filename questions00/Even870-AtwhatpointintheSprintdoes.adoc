The Sprint Backlog is created during Sprint Planning, although it can be adjusted any time throughout the Sprint.

The Sprint Backlog is a list of items that the Development Team plans to complete during the Sprint in order to achieve the Sprint Goal. It is an essential artifact in Scrum that is created during the Sprint Planning meeting.

The importance of the Sprint Backlog is as follows:

Transparency: The Sprint Backlog provides transparency to the Development Team and stakeholders regarding the work that will be completed during the Sprint. It helps to ensure that everyone is aligned with the work to be done and that everyone has a clear understanding of the Sprint Goal.

Focus: The Sprint Backlog helps the Development Team to focus on the work that needs to be completed during the Sprint. By creating a detailed list of work items, the team can prioritize and organize their work for the Sprint.

Commitment: The Sprint Backlog is a commitment by the Development Team to complete the items that are included in it. By agreeing to the work in the Sprint Backlog, the team is committing to achieving the Sprint Goal and delivering value to the stakeholders.

Adaptability: The Sprint Backlog is not set in stone, and it can be adjusted throughout the Sprint as needed. If new information or feedback becomes available, the Development Team can adjust.
