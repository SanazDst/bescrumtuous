Developers on a Scrum Team will select the best Product Backlog items to work on during the Sprint, and they are given the freedom to plan how best to implement those items. 

Working at a sustainable pace is a priority in Scrum. Developers should get as much of the work chosen for the Spring done as they can, but they shouldn't break their backs doing it.
