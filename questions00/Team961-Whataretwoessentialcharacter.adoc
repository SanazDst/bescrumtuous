[#explanation]

Options A and C are correct.

Every Scrum Developer is considered an equal. There are no sub-teams or sub-groups in Scrum.

There is nothing in the Scrum Guide that requires a Scrum Master to be 100% dedicated to a single Scrum Team. The Scrum Master can work with multiple Scrum Teams at the same time.
