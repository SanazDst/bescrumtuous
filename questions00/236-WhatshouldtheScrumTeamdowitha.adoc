[.explanation]
If a Product Backlog item doesn't meet the Definition of Done by the end of the Sprint, which means it's not complete, it goes back into the Product Backlog.

The Scrum Team will then decide if work on the backlog item should continue during the next Sprint, and if so, re-estimate the work needed to complete the undone PBI.

Avoid any answer on the Scrum certification exam that talks about 'points.' There is no mention of 'points' in the Scrum guide.****
