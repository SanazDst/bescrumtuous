The goal of the Sprint Review in Scrum is to inspect the increment of work completed by the team during the Sprint and to gather feedback from stakeholders. This helps the team to adapt their plan for the next Sprint and to ensure that the product continues to meet the needs of the stakeholders.

During the Sprint Review, the Scrum team shared the work that they completed during the Sprint and gathers feedback from the stakeholders, including the Product Owner and other interested parties. The feedback received during the review helps the team to adapt their plan for the next Sprint and to ensure that they are continuing to deliver value to the stakeholders.
