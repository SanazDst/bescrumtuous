If quality or testing is required as part of the Definition of Done, then quality and testing is a job performed by the developers.

There are not subteams or special hierarchies on a Scrum Team. Everyone who does development is simply seen as a developer.

"Within a Scrum Team, there are no sub-teams or hierarchies. It is a cohesive unit of professionals focused on one objective at a time, the Product Goal."
