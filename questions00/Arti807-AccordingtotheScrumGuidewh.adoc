[#explanation]
--
A Sprint Retrospective is the last Scrum Event to take place in the Sprint. It takes place after the Sprint Review.

All Scrum events happen within the boundaries of a Sprint. No events take place between Sprints in Scrum.

"The Sprint Retrospective concludes the Sprint. It is timeboxed to a maximum of three hours for a one-month Sprint. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter."
