[#answer]
AE

[#explanation]
--
The word 'role' is not found in the Scrum Guide. Scrum defines accountabilities, and there are three of them:

The Product Owner
The Scrum Master
Developers

Remember, there are no hierarchies or sub-groups on a Scrum team. There are no 'team leads' or 'senior developers.' There are no 'QA teams' or 'testing teams' either. They all fall under the 'developer' accountability.
