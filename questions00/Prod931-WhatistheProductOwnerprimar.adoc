[#answer]
D

[#explanation]

The answer to this question comes right out of the Scrum Guide:

"The Product Owner is accountable for maximizing the value of the product resulting from the work of the Scrum Team."

The Scrum Guide does not mention the term "use cases" or "user stories" so any reference to them on the Scrum certification exam is normally an _incorrect_ answer.

"Instilling quality by adhering to a Definition of Done" is actually something the Developers are accountable for according to Scrum.

Note that the _Developers_ select Product Backlog Items to work on during the Spring, not the Scrum Master or the Product Owner.
