The DevOps team is putting software into production that fails in terms of performance and security. The development team says they only deal with functional requirements, not non-functional requirements like security and performance. 

What's the best way for the Scrum Master to deal with this?

[#list]

* [ ] A. Share stories from the help desk about the issues the software is having.
* [*] B. Make sure non-functional requirements are clearly articulated in the Definition of Done.
* [ ] C. Run continuous integration tests throughout the Sprint and have developers address performance and security issues that arise before deployment.
* [*] D. Ask the Product Owner to add new Product Backlog items that deal specifically with performance and security.
* [ ] E. As the Scrum Master, you should push back on the DevOps team and explain that non-functional requrements are not part of the development team's planning tasks.

Developers must address both functional and non-functional requirements if they are an expected part of the product they are building.

To make sure an increment is not released without non-functional requirements being addressed, just add the non-functional requirements to the Definition of Done. That way an increment is not considered complete unless all functional and non-functional requirements have been dealt with.

Furthermore, having the Product Owner add non-functional requirements as backlog items gives them visibility and makes the Product Owner aware of them.

Functional and non-functional requirements are both important aspects of software development that help define what a software system should do and how it should perform. However, there are significant differences between the two types of requirements.

Functional requirements describe what a system should do in terms of specific features, functions, or behaviors. They are typically expressed as specific tasks, actions, or operations that the system should be able to perform. Examples of functional requirements include user authentication, data input and retrieval, reporting, and error handling. Functional requirements are often the most visible and tangible aspects of a software system and are usually easier to define and test than non-functional requirements.

Non-functional requirements, on the other hand, describe how a system should perform in terms of factors such as reliability, scalability, security, usability, and performance. Non-functional requirements are often more subjective and harder to quantify than functional requirements. They are usually expressed as constraints or quality attributes that the system should exhibit. Examples of non-functional requirements include response time, availability, user experience, and maintainability. Non-functional requirements are important because they help ensure that a system is usable, efficient, and effective, and can be sustained over time.
