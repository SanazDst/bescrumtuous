The purpose of the Sprint Review in Scrum is to review the value delivered in the current Sprint and examine the product increment that was developed during the Sprint to the Product Owner, stakeholders, and other members of the organization. 

The Sprint Review is a time-boxed event that takes place at the end of the sprint, and the Scrum team uses this opportunity to get feedback and insights from stakeholders on the product increment.

The Sprint Review provides the following benefits to the Scrum team:

Transparency: The Sprint Review provides transparency into the progress that has been made during the sprint and allows stakeholders to see the product increment and provide feedback.

Feedback: The Sprint Review provides a valuable opportunity to get feedback from stakeholders on the product increment that has been developed during the sprint. This feedback can be used to inform future sprints and help the team to prioritize the backlog.

Collaboration: The Sprint Review encourages collaboration between the Scrum team and stakeholders. This collaboration can lead to better communication and alignment between the team and stakeholders.

Continuous Improvement: The Sprint Review helps the team to continuously improve by identifying areas for improvement in the product, process, or team dynamics.
