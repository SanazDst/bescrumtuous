[#answer]
A

[#explanation]

This is true.

The Sprint Goal is finalized during Sprint Planning and remains constant throughout the Sprint. 

Changes can be made to the Sprint Plan and the Sprint Backlog during a Sprint, but the Sprint Goal remainds constant.

"The whole Scrum Team then collaborates to define a Sprint Goal that communicates why the Sprint is valuable to stakeholders. The Sprint Goal must be finalized prior to the end of Sprint Planning."
