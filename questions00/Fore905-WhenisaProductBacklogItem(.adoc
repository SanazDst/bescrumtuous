[#answer]
C

[#explanation]
--
A Product Backlog item is complete when all of its features are completed and it is not possible to create any further increments of work on it.

A Product Backlog item is not necessarily associated with a single Increment of Work. A PBI may last for multiple Sprints, with each Sprint producing an Increment of work that meets a Definition of Done for a given facet of a Product Backlog Item. That's why PBIs are decomposed by the development team - to break them up into manageable pieces of work.
