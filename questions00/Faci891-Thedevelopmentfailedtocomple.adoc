[#list]

* [ ] A. The Scrum Master extends future Sprints by the amount of time it would have required to complete all Sprint Backlog items.
* [*] B. The length of the Sprint remains the same, Sprint Backlog items get returned to the Product Backlog, and the Scrum Team tries to learn and adapt from the experience.
* [ ] C. The current Sprint is temporarily extended to allow all Sprint Backlog items to be completed. Insight is garnered at the Sprint Retrospective and the team adapts to avoid this situation in the future.
* [ ] D. There should be one Product Backlog shared across all teams.
* [ ] E. There should be five Product Owners, with each one 100% dedicated to their team.

B

[#explanation]

There is no changing the Sprint length. And it's not uncommon for some Sprint Backlog items to go uncompleted. They just go back into the Product Backlog.

The team should also turn it into a learning experience and adapt accordingly.
