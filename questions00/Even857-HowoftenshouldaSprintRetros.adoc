A Sprint Retrospective should be held as the last event to happen with a Sprint.

All Scrum events happen within the confines of a Sprint. Nothing happens 'after a Sprint' other than a new Sprint starting.

There is no Sprint Zero in Scrum. If you ever see that on the Scrum certification exam, it's an incorrect option.
