When multiple teams work on the same project, they share the same Product Backlog and Product Owner.

However, two problems that can arise are:

- Separate teams working on the same Product Backlog Items
- One team being blocked because their work depends on another team's work

To coordinate between teams and ensure two teams don't work on the same thing, the Product Owner must participate actively in Sprint Planning. 

In fact, it doesn't hurt to have members of other teams be present at a Sprint Planning meeting. This allows one team to get insight from other teams working on the same project.
