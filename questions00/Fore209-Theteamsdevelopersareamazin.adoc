The team's developers are amazing! Maybe too amazing?

It's not even half-way through the Sprint and the developers are telling you, the Scrum Master, that  they have not selected enough items for the Sprint. Everything is practically done, which will result in developers being underutilized with nothing to do for the rest of the Sprint. 

What should the Scrum Master do?

[#list]
--
* [ ] A. End the Sprint and reconvene a new Sprint Planning meeting.
* [ ] B. Have the Product Owner add new Product Backlog Items to the Sprint Backlog.
* [ ] C. Create a more rigorous definition of done so that it will require more work to complete the items currently in the Sprint Backlog
* [*] D. Have the developers adapt their Sprint Plan, possibly with the help of the Product Owner, and add additional, high-value Product Backlog Items to the Sprint Backlog.

[#answer]
D

[#explanation]
--
If developers complete Product Backlog Items quickly and become underutilized, they should adapt and add new Product Backlog Items to the Sprint Backlog.

Scrum is pragmatic. Its rules allow for simple solutions to problems that arise.

If developers didn't select enough work, then let them select more work! It's really that simple.
