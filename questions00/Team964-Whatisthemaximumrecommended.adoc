[#answer]
A

[#explanation]
--
According to the Scrum Guide, an optimal Scrum Team size is 10 or fewer. If there is a dedicated Scrum Master and Product Owner, the number of developers on the team would be 8.

"The Scrum Team is small enough to remain nimble and large enough to complete significant work within a Sprint, typically 10 or fewer people."
