D

[#explanation]

During Sprint Planning, the Developers pick Product Backlog items they believe the can complete before the end of the Sprint.

When a work meets the Definition of Done, the Product Backlog item is said to be complete, the work becomes part of the Increment, and the results are shared with stakeholders at the Sprint Review.

If developers fail to complete the Product Backlog item during the Sprint, the item returns to the Product Backlog. It may or may not be selected for the next Sprint. That's up for the team to decide at the next Sprint planning event.
