Ten separate Scrum teams are developing a very complex and highly integrated product. 

What role does the Scrum Master play in ensuring each team can successfully integrate their software together with other teams without merge conflicts or incompatible deployments?

--

[#list]
--
* [ ] A. The Scrum Master should have the Product Owner coordinate with a designated team lead from each Scrum Team and reach an agreement on when Product Backlog items will be integrated together.
* [*] B. The Scrum Master should coach the ten teams on how to be self-managed and have the teams come up with their own solutions on how to integrate code together.
* [ ] C. The Scrum Master should visit each team at the start of their Sprints to ensure no two teams are working on the same task. This will make integration easier.
* [ ] D. Since the Product Owner (PO) is shared across all teams on the same project, the Scrum Master makes sure the PO visits each team regularly to coordinate integrations.

[#answer]
B

[#explanation]

If you think a Scrum Master or a Product Owner is going to be able to figure out how to integrate code across 10 separate teams working on a complicated project, they you've never met a Scrum Master or a Product Owner.

The Product Owner manages the Product Backlog, and the Scrum Master coaches and facilitates, but they can't solve technical issues for the development teams. 

All a Scrum Master can do is coach those teams and help them discover their own solutions that work within the intentionally incomplete framework known as Scrum.
