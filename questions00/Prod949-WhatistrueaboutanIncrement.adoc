[#explanation]

An Increment is indeed a Scrum artifact and it contains, or represents, a commitment to the Definition of Done. An increment is not a commitment to the the Product Goal. The Product Backlog contains a commitment to the Product Goal.

Every increment must be usable, and it must be compatible with all past increments.
