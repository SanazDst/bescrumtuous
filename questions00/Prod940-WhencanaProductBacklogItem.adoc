[#answer]
C

[#explanation]
--
A Product Backlog item is considered to be ready for release when there is nothing left to do on it. That means nothing remains in the Product Backlog.

Note that the Sprint Backlog might only include part of a decomposed Product Backlog Item. So just because Sprint Backlog Items related to a PBI are complete doesn't mean the PBI as a whole is completed.
