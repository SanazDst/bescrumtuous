BCE

[#explanation]

The Product Goal is not part of the Sprint, and the term 'Sprint Backlog item' does not appear anywhere in the Scrum Guide. Instead, Product Backlog items are selected for the Sprint, but they are not specifically called Sprint Backlog items in the Guide.

There is no such thing as a 'Definition of Ready' in Scrum. In fact, many Agile practitioners feel the 'Definition of Ready' is an anti-pattern.
