All events in Scrum happen within the confines of a Sprint. That includes Sprint Planning, the Sprint Retrospective, the Sprint Review and the development Sprint as well. That all happens within the boundaries of a single Sprint.

Nothing happens outside of a Sprint.

All events or ceremonies are designed to occur within a Sprint because it helps to ensure that the team is consistently working towards the goals and objectives of the Sprint.

The Sprint is a time-boxed iteration of development work, typically 1-4 weeks long, during which the team works to complete the items on the Sprint Backlog. All of the Scrum events are scheduled to occur within the boundaries of a Sprint, so that the team can have a clear and focused work cycle.

Here are a few reasons why all Scrum events occur within a Sprint:

Improved focus: By scheduling all Scrum events within a Sprint, the team can maintain their focus on the Sprint goal and avoid distractions that could prevent them from delivering the work that they committed to completing during the Sprint.

Predictability: The time-boxed nature of the Sprint helps to make the Scrum process more predictable. The team knows when to expect each event, which helps them to plan and prioritize their work more effectively.

Continuous feedback and improvement: The Scrum events within a Sprint are designed to provide regular opportunities for inspection and adaptation. By reviewing progress and feedback during each event, the team can make adjustments and improve their processes on an ongoing basis.

Overall, by scheduling all events within a Sprint, Scrum provides a framework that promotes focus, predictability, and continuous improvement.
