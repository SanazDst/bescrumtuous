[#explanation]

According to the Scrum Guide, "The Sprint Backlog is composed of the Sprint Goal (why), the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint (what), as well as an actionable plan for delivering the Increment (how)."

Remember that the Sprint Backlog is all about why, what and how!

Note that all events happen _within_ the Sprint. So Sprint Planning happens for the current Sprint, not the 'next' Sprint. Sprint Planning, development, the Sprint Review and the Sprint Retrospective all happen with the boundaries of the same Sprint.
