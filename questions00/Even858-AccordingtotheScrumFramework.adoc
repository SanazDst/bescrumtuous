The Sprint Goal is created and finalized during Sprint Planning.

The Sprint Goal is a critical element of the Scrum framework, which is created during Sprint Planning and is intended to guide the Scrum team in their work throughout the Sprint. The Sprint Goal is a concise summary of what the team plans to achieve during the Sprint, which should be aligned with the Product Goal and support the overall product vision.

The Sprint Goal is important because it provides focus and direction to the team, enabling them to make decisions about what work to prioritize and how to approach it. It helps the team to stay aligned and motivated, and it also provides a basis for tracking progress and determining whether the Sprint has been successful.

Once the Sprint Goal is set during Sprint Planning, it cannot be changed during the Sprint. 

This is because the Sprint Goal is intended to provide a clear and stable target for the team to work towards, and changing it mid-Sprint could cause confusion and disrupt the team's focus. If the Product Owner determines during the Sprint that they need to change the Sprint Goal due to unforeseen circumstances or new information, the Product Owner can end the Sprint. A new Sprint Planning session will set a new Sprint Goal that reflects the updated understanding of the work that needs to be done.

The Sprint Goal is an important aspect of Scrum because it provides a clear and stable target for the team to work towards during the Sprint. It cannot be changed during the Sprint to ensure that the team remains focused and aligned throughout the Sprint.
