C

[#explanation]
--
According to the Scrum Guide, a Sprint's duration is one month or less.

"They are fixed length events of one month or less to create consistency. A new Sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous Sprint."

Note that the phrase "from a couple of weeks to a couple of months" is from the Agile Manifesto.
