The development team bit off more than it could chew during Sprint Planning. 

They've just told you, the Scrum Master, that there's no way they are even going to come close to completing the Sprint Backlog.

What should you, as the Scrum Master, do?

[#list]
--
* [ ] A. Change the Definition of Done and negotiate the quality standard with the Product Owner to ensure all Sprint Backlog items are completed before the end of the Sprint.
* [*] B. While the Sprint is ongoing, have the Product Owner and the developers negotiate the scope of the work being done so as not to endanger the Sprint Goal.
* [ ] C. Scale out and assign some of the Sprint Backlog items to an external Scrum Team.
* [ ] D. Inform the Product Owner prior to the Sprint Review so the stakeholders won't be disappointed.

It's not unusual to have a Sprint go sideways. When that happens, the Scrum Team has to adapt.

It's acceptable to clarify and negotiate scope during a Sprint. According to the Scrum Guide:

During the Sprint:

- No changes are made that would endanger the Sprint Goal;
- Quality does not decrease;
- The Product Backlog is refined as needed; and,
- Scope may be clarified and renegotiated with the Product Owner as more is learned.
