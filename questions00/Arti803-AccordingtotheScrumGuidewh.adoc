D

[#explanation]

The Development Team owns the Sprint Backlog.

The Development Team owns the Sprint Backlog because they are the ones who will be doing the work. They are the experts in the technical aspects of the project and are best positioned to determine what tasks are necessary to deliver the product increment. They have the knowledge and skills required to estimate the effort needed for each item and to determine the order in which they should be completed.

While the Product Owner is responsible for prioritizing the Product Backlog, they are not responsible for creating or managing the Sprint Backlog. The Product Owner may work with the Development Team to refine the items in the Product Backlog and provide guidance on priorities, but the final decision on what work to include in the Sprint Backlog ultimately lies with the Development Team.

The Scrum Master's role is to facilitate the Scrum process. They are not involved in managing the Sprint Backlog, but they may provide support and guidance to the Development Team as needed.
