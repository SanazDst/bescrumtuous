[#answer]
B

[#explanation]

This is false.

A Scrum Team is expected to create a usable increment before the end of each Sprint, but there is no requirement to release it into production.

Scrum is a lightweight framework with very few 'hard and fast' rules. Whenever you see the world 'must' on the Scrum Master Certification exam, it's likely an incorrect option.
