In Scrum, the Definition of Done is an important concept that helps ensure that each Product Backlog Item (PBI) meets the team's agreed-upon quality standards. When a PBI is marked complete without meeting the Definition of Done, it can hurt transparency and trust between the Scrum team and its stakeholders in a few ways:

It can result in misleading metrics: If a PBI is marked as complete when it doesn't meet the Definition of Done, it can give stakeholders a false sense of progress or completion. This can lead to inaccurate metrics, such as velocity or burn-down charts, which can impact the team's ability to plan and estimate future work.

It can result in rework or technical debt: If a PBI is marked as complete without meeting the Definition of Done, it can result in rework or technical debt down the line. This can impact the team's ability to deliver high-quality work and can lead to delays and decreased productivity.

It can damage trust and transparency: If stakeholders discover that a PBI has been marked as complete without meeting the Definition of Done, it can damage trust and transparency between the Scrum team and its stakeholders. Stakeholders may feel that the team is not being transparent about the work that has been done, which can lead to communication breakdowns and decreased collaboration.

To avoid these issues, it's important for the Scrum team to ensure that each PBI meets the Definition of Done before marking it as complete. This helps to maintain transparency and trust between the Scrum team and its stakeholders and ensures that work is delivered to a high standard of quality.
