[#answer]
A

[#explanation]
--
A Sprint expires when the predetermined length for the Sprint expires.

A Sprint may be two weeks, three weeks or four weeks. That's up to the team to decide.

Once the time allotted for the Sprint expires, the Sprint ends and a new Sprint begins.

Even if Product Backlog items are not finished, or even if the team failed to deliver any Increment of value, the Sprint is not extended. When the allotted time-box is met, the Sprint ends.

To answer this question even more concisely, the Sprint ends at the end of the Sprint Retrospective. The Sprint Retrospective is the last event in Scrum, and when this event finishes, a new Sprint begins.
