[.list]
* [ ] A. Stakeholders
* [ ] B. Product Owners
* [ ] C. The Scrum Master

[.answer]
D

[.explanation]
The Daily Scrum is for the development team.

Only the developers are allowed to participate in the Daily Scrum. The only time a Scrum Master or Product Owner is allowed to participate in the Daily Scrum is if they are actually doing some development work on a Product Backlog Item themselves, but even then they would be participating as a developer, not a Product Owner or Scrum Master.

Anyone can attend the Daily Scrum. But only developers can participate.****
