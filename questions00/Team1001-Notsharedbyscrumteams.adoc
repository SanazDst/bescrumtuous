[#answer]
BCF

[#explanation]
--
When multiple Scrum Teams work on the development of the same product, they share the same:

- Product Owner
- Product Goal
- Definition of Done

Each team has its own Sprint Backlog. The Sprint Goal is part of the Sprint Backlog.

The Scrum Master may or may not be shared. The Scrum Guide neither recommends or forbids it.

There is no such thing as the 'Definition of Ready' in Scrum.
