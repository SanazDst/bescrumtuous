A Scrum Team is expected to be cross-functional and have all the skills needed to address the issues that arise. The team should be able to make decisions without consulting external specialists.

A self-managed, cross-functional team is also expected to resolve conflicts on their own. From the Scrum perspective, and certainly on the Scrum Master certification exam, going to Human Resources to resolve a problem is not a prescribed approach. The Scrum Guide never even mentions the term "Human Resources.'

A Scrum Master coaches and facilitates in order to help the development team come to their own conclusions and find paths to help them  move forward.
