****

[#answer]

The correct answer is D.

[#explanation]
--
The Sprint Goal must be finalized before the end of Sprint Planning and it cannot be changed throughout the Sprint.

According to the Scrum Guide, "the whole Scrum Team then collaborates to define a Sprint Goal that communicates why the Sprint is valuable to stakeholders. The Sprint Goal must be finalized prior to the end of Sprint Planning."

As the Scrum Master, it is clear to you that the Sprint Goal is not going to be reached if the Sprint Backlog isn't adjusted and new items aren't added. 

In Scrum, who has the right to add items to the Sprint Backlog?

* [*] B. The development team owns the Sprint Backlog and can add items to it at any time during the Sprint.
* [ ] C. Both the Scrum Master and the developers can add to the Sprint Backlog if  changes need to be made to keep the Sprint Goal in focus.

--
****

How might a Scrum Master help the Scrum Team resolve an internal disagreement that has caused inter-personal conflicts between team members.
--

[#list]
--
* [*] A. Use various coaching and facilitation techniques such as open feedback and active listening.
* [*] B. Involve everyone on the team of Scrum Developers in forming a resolution that is in line with the Scrum values.

* [ ] D. Incorporate the Human Resources department to help resolve any inter-personal conflicts that have arisen.
* [*] E. Coach the team on maintaining a psychologically safe environment for all participants.
--
****

[#answer]

The correct answers are A, B and E.

[#explanation]
--
A Scrum Team is expected to be cross-functional and have all the skills needed to address issues that arise. The team should be able to make independent decisions without consulting external specialists.

A self-managed, cross-functional team is also expected to resolve conflicts on their own. From the Scrum perspective, and certainly on the Scrum Master certification exam, going to Human Resources to resolve a problem is not a prescribed approach. The Scrum Guide never mentions the term "Human Resources.'

A Scrum Master coaches and facilitates in order to help the development team come to their own conclusions and find paths to help them move forward.

- Quality does not decrease;
- The Product Backlog is refined as needed; and,
- Scope may be clarified and renegotiated with the Product Owner as more is learned.

The correct answers are B and C.

[#explanation]
--
The Scrum Team should have all the skills required to meet the Definition of Done (DoD). If the DoD depends on work performed outside of the team, there is no control over it and it jeopardizes the team's ability to create a full Increment.

The development team should also be self-organized and self-managed. Openness and transparency may be problematic if developers are complaining to the Scrum Master in confidence.

==== Answer 7
****


[#query]
--
If the company you work for does not have an organizational standard that defines the Definition of Done, whose responsibility is it to provide a definition before development begins?
--

[#list]
--
* [ ] A. The development team
* [ ] B. The Product Owner
* [*] C. The Scrum Team, which includes the Scrum Master and Product Owner
* [ ] D. The Definition of Done is formed from a consensus between the Scrum Master and the Product Owner

--
****

[#answer]

The correct answer is C.

[#explanation]
--
According to the Scrum Guide:

"If the Definition of Done for an increment is part of the standards of the organization, all Scrum Teams must follow it as a minimum. 

If it is not an organizational standard, the Scrum Team must create a Definition of Done appropriate for the product."

In Scrum, the Definition of Done (DoD) is a shared understanding of what it means for a Product Backlog item to be considered complete and ready to be integrated into the product. The Scrum Team, which includes the Product Owner, the development team and the Scrum Master, collaborates to create the Definition of Done if an organizational standard for the DoD does not already exist.

Ultimately, the Definition of Done should be agreed upon by the entire Scrum Team and should reflect the standards and expectations for delivering a high-quality product to the customer.

[#query]
--
Under which circumstance can the Scrum Master extend the length of the Sprint once the Sprint has started?
--

[#list]
--
* [ ] A. The Sprint can be extended equal to the number of days a Product Owner is absent
* [ ] B. The Sprint can be extended equal to the number of holidays that occurred during the Sprint
* [ ] C. The Sprint length can be changed any time prior to the end of the Sprint Planning meeting
* [*] D. The Sprint length cannot be changed after a Sprint has started


--
****

[#answer]

The correct answer is D.

[#explanation]
-- 
Once a Sprint has started, the Sprint length cannot be changed.

Changes to the length of the Sprint should be agreed upon by a consensus of the team. 

The best time to discuss changing the length of the Sprint is during the Sprint Retrospective. Any changes made to the Sprint length during a Sprint would apply only to future Sprints, not the current Sprint.

Which of the following Scrum events are time-boxed to limit the amount of time spent on them?
--

[#list]
--
* [ ] A. Standup Meetings.
* [ ] B. The Release Sprint.
* [*] C. The Sprint Retrospective.
* [*] D. Sprint Planning. 
* [ ] E. Stakeholder Meetings.
* [ ] F. Sprint Zero.
* [*] G. The Daily Scrum.

--
****

[#answer]

The correct answers are C, D and G.

[#explanation]
--
The Sprint Retrospective is a time-boxed event that occurs at the end of each Sprint and allows the team to reflect on their processes and identify areas for improvement. 

Sprint Planning is also time-boxed and occurs at the beginning of each Sprint, allowing the team to plan and prioritize their work for the upcoming Sprint. 

The Daily Scrum is another time-boxed event that occurs daily during the Sprint and allows the team to synchronize their work and plan for the day.

Options A, B, E, and F are not correct because they are not Scrum events. They may be performed by some Scrum Teams, but they are not discussed at all in the Scrum Guide.

Which of the following is true about the Product Owner's attendance at the Daily Scrum?
--

[#list]
--
* [ ] B. The Product Owner must always attend the Daily Scrum to help remove any impediments that exist that jeopardize the Sprint Goal
* [ ] B. The Product Owner must always attend the Daily Scrum so they can quickly answer any questions the Scrum Developers have about items they are working on.
* [ ] C. The Product Owner must always attend the Daily Scrum to present the stakeholder's point of view.
* [*] D. The Product Owner doesn't need to attend the Daily Scrum.

--
****

[#answer]

The correct answer is D.

[#explanation]
--
The Product Owner does not participate in the the Daily Scrum, nor are they required to attend it. They only participate in the Daily Scrum at the behest of the Scrum Developers.

Not even the Scrum Master is required to attend the Daily Scrum.

The Daily Scrum is for the development team.

Unless the Scrum Master or Product Owner is actually doing development for some reason and acting as a developer working on a backlog item, then they should not participate in the Daily Scrum. The Daily Scrum is for the developers only.

[#query]
--
Under what circumstances might the decision be made to prematurely terminate a Sprint?
--

[#list]
--
* [ ] A. When a self-managed team of Scrum Developers realizes the work committed to during Sprint planning cannot possibly be delivered by the end of the Sprint.
* [*] B. When the Sprint Goal no longer makes sense and becomes obsolete.
* [ ] C. When the Scrum Development team's work needs to be redirected to new opportunities.
* [ ] D. When the Product Owner reprioritized the Product Backlog and PBIs currently under development are no longer priorities.

--
****

[#answer]

The correct answer is B.

[#explanation]
--

When the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete the Product Owner can canel the Sprint.

In Scrum, the Sprint Goal is a short statement that describes what the Development Team intends to achieve during the Sprint. It provides focus and direction to the team and helps to ensure that all members are working towards a common objective. The Sprint Goal is set during Sprint Planning and remains unchanged throughout the Sprint.

If the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete, it means that the objective that the Scrum Developers set for the Sprint is no longer relevant. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as changes in the business environment or new information that makes the Sprint Goal irrelevant. Essentially, something happened that makes working towards the Sprint Goal a complete waste of time.

When the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete, the Scrum framework allows for the Sprint to be cancelled by the Product Owner.

It is important to note that cancelling a Sprint is not a decision that should be taken lightly. If Sprints are cancelled frequently, it can indicate deeper problems with the project that need to be addressed.

The Daily Scrum is time boxed to 15 minutes, not 30 minutes.

From the Scrum Guide: "The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute event for the Developers of the Scrum Team. 

Daily Scrums improve communications, identify impediments, promote quick decision-making, and consequently eliminate the need for other meetings."

The development team failed to complete all the items in the Sprint Backlog before the end of the Sprint. What happens next?
--

[#list]
--
* [ ] A. The Scrum Master extends future Sprints by the amount of time it would have required to complete all Sprint Backlog items.
* [*] B. The length of the Sprint remains the same, Sprint Backlog items get returned to the Product Backlog, and the Scrum Team tries to learn and adapt from the experience.
* [ ] C. The current Sprint is temporarily extended to allow all Sprint Backlog items to be completed. Insight is garnered at the Sprint Retrospective and the team adapts to avoid this situation in the future.
* [ ] D. There should be one Product Backlog shared across all teams.
* [ ] E. There should be five Product Owners, with each one 100% dedicated to their team.

--
****

[#answer]

The correct answer is B.

[#explanation]
--
There is no changing the Sprint length. 

It's not uncommon for some Sprint Backlog items to go uncompleted. They just go back into the Product Backlog.

The team should discuss why their estimates were off during the Sprint Retrospective. The Scrum Team should turn the situation into a learning experience and adapt accordingly.

* [*] D. Teach the development team about collaboriate techniques to build consensus, such as actively listening to others.

--
****

[#answer]

The correct answers are C and D.

[#explanation]
--
Coaching and teaching are important parts of the Scrum Master's role as a servant-leader.

Active listening and open questioning are important skills in effective communication, particularly in Scrum where collaboration and continuous feedback are key. However, there are other techniques and approaches that can also be useful in communication, including:

Reflective listening: This involves reflecting back what the speaker has said to demonstrate that you understand their message. For example, "So what I hear you saying is that you're concerned about the timeline for this project."

Summarizing: This involves summarizing what has been said to ensure that everyone is on the same page. For example, "Let me make sure I understand - you're saying that we need to focus on improving the user experience for this feature."

Paraphrasing: This involves restating what has been said in your own words to show that you understand and to encourage clarification. For example, "If I'm understanding you correctly, you're suggesting that we approach this problem from a different angle."

Nonverbal communication: This includes using body language, eye contact, and facial expressions to show that you are engaged and paying attention.

Visualization: This involves using diagrams, sketches, or other visual aids to help communicate ideas and concepts.

Silence: Sometimes, allowing a pause in the conversation can give the speaker time to gather their thoughts and provide a more thoughtful response.

While active listening and open questioning are valuable techniques in communication, incorporating these alternatives can help to build trust and improve collaboration in a Scrum team.

Corporate stakeholders are very busy, as multiple projects are going online this quarter.

The stakeholders have asked to attend every-other Sprint Review to minimize the number of meetings on their calendars. How do you as a Scrum Master respond?
--

[#list]
--
* [*] A. Coach the stakeholders and the team on how to make the meetings more productive and positive.
* [ ] B. Agree with the request of the stakeholders, as reducing meetings is in line with Agile principles.
* [*] C. Educate stakeholders on the importance of Sprint Reviews and work to facilitate more engaging Sprint Reviews.

[#answer]

The correct answers are A and C.

[#explanation]
--
The Scrum Master should use this opportunity to explain the importance of a Sprint Review and the value the team receives from the stakeholders participating in it.

Attendance at Scrum events is not optional, nor is running Scrum events as planned. Stakeholders must participate in the Sprint Review.

Which of the following actions should the Scrum Master never do?
--

[#list]
--
* [*] A. Tell the Scrum Developers how to manage their workloads.
* [*] B. Extend the length of the Sprint.
* [*] C. End the Sprint early.
* [ ] D. Coach the Development Team to ensure the Daily Scrum is time-boxed to 15 minutes.
* [*] E. Reprimand developers who underperform.
--
****

[#answer]

The correct answers are A, B, C and E.

[#explanation]
--
The Scrum Master is a leader who serves the team and as such, should never _tell_ the developers what to do. The Scrum Master coaches and facilitates and allows developers to discover solutions and solve problems themselves.

Furthermore, the Scrum Framework does not allow the length of a Sprint to be extended, and only the Product Owner can end a Sprint early.

The Scrum Master does coach teams about the Scrum Framework, so coaching a team to ensure the 15 minute Daily Scrum timebox is not exceeded is a good use of the Scrum Master's time.

[#answer]

The correct answers are D and E.

[#explanation]
--
It is up to the developers to decide how to run their Daily Scrum, which includes decisions about who starts it and how it proceeds.

"The Developers can select whatever structure and techniques they want, as long as their Daily Scrum focuses on progress toward the Sprint Goal and produces an actionable plan for the next day of work. This creates focus and improves self-management."

Furthermore, there are no 'team leads' or 'junior developers' in the eyes of Scrum. 

According to the Scrum Guide: "Within a Scrum Team, there are no sub-teams or hierarchies. It is a cohesive unit of professionals focused on one objective at a time, the Product Goal."

[#answer]

The correct answer is D.

[#explanation]
--
A trend line through a release burndown chart indicates how fast work is being completed relative to the original plan, and can help visualize progress toward completion of the component being graphed, be it a Sprint or a decomposed Product Backlog item.

The Scrum Guide only makes a short reference to burndown charts, and even then, it says they are not a replacement for empiricism.

You don't need to be a burndown chart expert, but knowing what one is will keep you from being caught off guard on the Scrum certification exam.

When is a Product Backlog item (PBI) considered fully complete and ready for release?
--

[#list]
--


* [ ] A. A Product Backlog item is complete when a Quality Assurance team verifies that the work passes all acceptance criteria, making it ready for release
* [ ] B. A Product Backlog item is complete when all work in the Sprint Backlog related to the item is finished, making it ready for release
* [*] C. A Product Backlog item is complete when further Increments of Work on it are no longer possible, making it ready for release.
* [ ] D. Product Backlog items are never officially complete until the Product Goal is achieved.

--
****

[#answer]

The correct answer is C.

[#explanation]
--
A Product Backlog item is complete when all of its features are completed and it is not possible to create any further increments of work on it.

A Product Backlog item is not necessarily associated with a single Increment of Work. A PBI may last for multiple Sprints, with each Sprint producing an Increment of work that meets a Definition of Done for a given facet of a Product Backlog Item. That's why PBIs are decomposed by the development team - to break them up into manageable pieces of work.

What are the skills and capabilities the Developers on the Scrum Team should have in order to ensure effective performance throughout the Sprint?

--

[#list]
--
* [*] A. The ability to decompose Product Backlog items (PBIs) and progressively create Increments of Work until a functional release is possible.
* [ ] B. The ability to perform all of the core software development work, with the exception of any specialized testing that would require additional tools and staging environments.
* [ ] C. The ability to complete a development project within budget and within the timeline agreed upon with the Product Owner.
* [ ] D. The ability to take direction from the Scrum Master and complete Product Backlog items assigned to them by the Product Owner.

--
****

[#answer]

The correct answer is A.

[#explanation]
--
The Scrum Development team must be able to decompose a PBI and create as many Increments of Work that are necessary to complete the PBI and make the item ready for release.

A Product Backlog Item (PBI) is often very _high-level_ description of a feature or a function. The Product Owner will know what they want, but they won't always know how to 'get there.' 

For example, maybe a Product Owner wants to build a house. They are unlikely to have anything in the Product Backlog about pouring a foundation or connecting to the main sewage line. Those are details the Scrum Developers will have to flush out as they decompose the Product Backlog items.

Decomposing a PBI means breaking it down into smaller, more manageable pieces of work that can be completed by the Scrum development team during a Sprint. The goal is to decompose Product Backlog items down into units of work that can be accomplished in a single day.

The process of decomposing a PBI involves analyzing it in more detail, identifying the sub-tasks, dependencies, and other factors involved, and then creating smaller Product Baclkog items that can be individually prioritized, estimated, and worked on by the team. This allows the team to better understand the requirements of the PBI and the work involved, which in turn helps with planning and delivering the work effectively.

Decomposition is an ongoing process throughout the Scrum framework. 

As the team progresses through the Sprint, they may discover additional details or dependencies that require further decomposition of Product Baclkog items, or they may need to adjust their plan based on feedback from stakeholders or changes in the product's requirements. By continually decomposing Product Baclkog items, the team can ensure they have a clear understanding of the work involved and can prioritize, estimate, and deliver the product backlog items more effectively.

* [ ] D. How quickly the project will be completed if Product Backlog items are slowly removed by the Product Owner.

--
****

[#answer]

The correct answer is C.

[#explanation]
--
Don't worry too much about burn-down charts, as they are only briefly mentioned in the Scrum Guide. But they are used quite a bit by teams who use tools like JIRA for Scrum management.

"Various practices exist to forecast progress, like burn-downs, burn-ups, or cumulative flows. While
proven useful, these do not replace the importance of empiricism." - The Scrum Guide.

A trend line displayed on a release burndown chart indicates the progress of a project over time. The release burndown chart is a visual representation of the amount of work remaining to complete a project, plotted against time. The trend line is a line that is fitted to the actual data points on the chart, and it represents the expected progress of the project if it were to continue at the same rate as it has been progressing up to that point in time.

If the trend line is sloping downwards, it indicates that the project is progressing at a rate that is consistent with the plan, and the work is being completed on schedule. If the trend line is sloping upwards, it indicates that the project is falling behind schedule, and the work is not being completed at the expected rate.

It is important to note that the trend line is a projection based on past performance, and it may not accurately predict the future progress of the project. It is a predictor, but it is not an empirical measure. Therefore, it is important to regularly review and update the release burndown chart to ensure that the project is on track to meet its goals.

Breaking Product Backlog Items into smaller work items is the job of the developers on the team.

"For each selected Product Backlog item, the Developers plan the work necessary to create an Increment that meets the Definition of Done. 

This is often done by decomposing Product Backlog items into smaller work items of one day or less. How this is done is at the sole discretion of the Developers. 

Noone else tells them how to turn Product Backlog items into Increments of value."

[#query]

The team's developers are amazing! Maybe too amazing?

It's not even half-way through the Sprint and the developers are telling you, the Scrum Master, that they have not selected enough items for the Sprint. Everything is practically done, which will result in developers being underutilized with nothing to do for the rest of the Sprint. 

What should the Scrum Master do?
--

[#list]
--
* [ ] A. End the Sprint and reconvene a new Sprint Planning meeting.
* [ ] B. Have the Product Owner add new Product Backlog items to the Sprint Backlog.
* [ ] C. Create a more rigorous Definition of Done so that quality will improve and it will require more work to complete the items currently in the Sprint Backlog
* [*] D. Have the developers adapt their Sprint Plan, preferably with the help of the Product Owner, and add additional, high-value Product Backlog items to the Sprint Backlog.

--
****

[#answer]

The correct answer is D.

[#explanation]
--
If developers complete Sprint Backlog items quickly and become underutilized, they should adapt and add new Product Backlog items to the Sprint Backlog.

Scrum is pragmatic. Scrum's rules allow for simple solutions to problems that arise.

If developers didn't select enough work, then let them select more work. It's really that simple.

Never overcomplicate Scrum.

During every Sprint, the team attempts to create at least one Increment to present to stakeholders during the Sprint Review.

Why might a Product Owner refuse to immediately release an Increment into production after a successful Sprint Review?
--

[#list]
--
* [ ] A. Increments are automatically released into production so it is not possible to refuse a release.
* [ ] B. The Product Owner needs confirmation from the Scrum Master in order to release an increment into production.
* [*] C. The immediate timing of the release does not make sense for customers or stakeholders.
* [ ] D. The Product Owner never refuses to release an Increment into production.

--
****

[#answer]

The correct answer is C.

[#explanation]
--
If the timing of the release of an Increment is not in the best interest of users or stakeholders, the Product Owner does not need to release it immediately.

For example, a Christmas Theme for the website might be completed in late October. You wouldn't publish the website's Christmas theme two months before Christmas.

Increments don't need to be released or published immediately. They can be released when they make the most sense for the organization, stakeholders and customers.

[#answer]

The correct answer is A.

[#explanation]
--
In the Scrum framework, the Product Owner is responsible for creating and maintaining the Product Backlog, which is an ordered list of features, enhancements, and fixes that the Scrum Team will work on in order to deliver a product Increment. 

The Product Owner prioritizes the items in the Product Backlog based on a variety of factors that relate to how the items bring value to the business. Generally speaking, items that are believed to provide the most value to the product's users and customers are placed at the top of the list, and those that are of lower priority are placed towards the bottom.

* [*] A. Return the item to the Product Backlog.
* [ ] B. With the consent of the Product Owner and stakeholders, the PBI can be approved and released.
* [ ] C. Automatically add the unfinished PBI to the next Sprint's backlog.
* [*] D. Make sure the team knows that work on this PBI will not be included in the current Sprint's Increment.

--
****

[#answer]

The correct answers are A and D.

[#explanation]
--
Incomplete PBIs not completed in a given Sprint are returned to the Product Backlog.

They are not automatically added to the next Sprint, as priorities may have changed since the prior round of Sprint Planning took place.

If a PBI is not completed, it definitely should not be added to the Increment. The Incrememt is only for completed work that meets the DoD.

The Product Backlog is the ordered list of features, requirements, and other work items that the development team plans to complete over the course of the project. During each Sprint, the team selects a subset of items from the Product Backlog to work on, creating a Sprint Backlog.

One of the key principles of Scrum is that the team commits to completing the work it selects for the Sprint Backlog within the Sprint. However, if any Product Backlog items are not completed by the end of the Sprint, they are not automatically added to the next Sprint Backlog. Instead, they are returned to the Product Backlog for reprioritization and consideration for future Sprints.

According to the Scrum Guide, which two of the following statements is true about the Product Owner?
--

[#list]
--
* [*] A. The Product Owner may delegate the creation of Product Backlog items to an associate.
* [ ] B. The Product Owner may be a committee or collection of individuals who collaboratively perform the role.
* [*] C. The organization must fully respect and trust the independent decisions of the Product Owner.
* [ ] D. The Product Owner should coach the developers in self-management and cross-functionality.
* [ ] E. The Product Owner must attend and participate in the Daily Scrum.

--
****

[#answer]

The correct answers are A and C.

[#explanation]
--

The Product Owner is allowed to delegate certain aspects of their job to others on the team, as the Scrum Guide indicates:

"The Product Owner ... may delegate the responsibility to others. Regardless, the Product Owner remains accountable. For Product Owners to succeed, the entire organization must respect their decisions. These decisions are visible in the content and ordering of the Product Backlog, and through the inspectable Increment at the Sprint Review. The Product Owner is one person, not a committee."

The organization must also fully trust the decisions of the Product Owner. They must be trusted to make quick decisions about the product so that developers can get fast responses and quickly resolve issues.

You are building a limo for a head of state, and security and protection of the occupant are two important, non-functional requirements that must be prioritized at every step in the development process. 

What is the best way to ensure security and protection of the occupant are prioritized?
--

[#list]
--
* [ ] A. Outsource security and protection concerns to an external third party that specializes in these areas.
* [ ] B. Add a Sprint prior to the release of the car that deals exclusively with security and protection.
* [ ] C. Build a special sub-team on the development team that deals exclusively with security and protection of the occupant.
* [*] D. Have the Product Owner add the features that pertain to security and protection of the occupant to the Product Backlog.
* [*] E. Add concerns related to the security and protection of the occupant to the Definition of Done.

--
****

[#answer]

The correct answers are D and E.

[#explanation]
--
We don't outsource work in Scrum, nor do we create sub-teams. 

From the Scrum Guide: "Scrum Teams are cross-functional, meaning the members have all the skills necessary to create value each Sprint. Within a Scrum Team, there are no sub-teams or hierarchies. It is a cohesive unit of professionals focused on one objective at a time, the Product Goal."

In Scrum, we deal with non-functional requirements by either adding Product Backlog Items that address these concerns, or we add non-functional criteria to the Definition of Done.

[#query]

You, the Scrum Master, have been told that the quality assurance (QA) tests performed by an external team have been delayed, and due to this delay, it's unlikely the Definition of Done will be achieved before the end of this 3-week Sprint. However, if the Sprint was extended a week, the QA work would likely be done. 

How would you proceed as a Scrum Master? (Choose 2)
--

[#list]
--
* [ ] A. Extend the Sprint a week to allow QA team to complete their work.
* [*] B. Investigate why the Scrum Team does not have all the cross-functional skills to achieve the Definition of Done without an external QA team
* [ ] C. Remove QA work from the Definition of Done for this Sprint.
* [*] D. Explain to the organization that Scrum is not designed to manage the work performed by people external to the Scrum Team.
* [ ] E. Turn the next Sprint into a 'Performance and Security' sprint and focus on these two non-functional aspects of the code.

--
****

[#answer]

The correct answers are B and D.

[#explanation]
--
A Scrum Team must have all of the skills necessary to complete the Definition of Done. The Scrum Team cannot outsource work that is part of their Definition of Done and still have that work managed through Scrum.

Extending the Sprint is never an option. The Sprint length is fixed when the Sprint starts.

The Definition of Done can always be discussed and updated. However, the Scrum Master does not have the right to unilaterally change the Definition of Done, and changes to the Definition of Done are best discussed in the Sprint Retrospective.

Furthermore, the Definition of Done should not be changed midway through a Sprint to accommodate moving goalposts. Doing so would be antithetical to Scrum.

What are the two primary responsibilities of a new Product Owner when taking ownership of a product that is currently under development with a long history of multiple, successful Sprints?
--

[#list]
--
* [*] A. Ensuring that the development teams know which Product Backlog items provide the greatest value and should be developed first
* [ ] B. Describing and fully decomposing product features in Use Case and story form.
* [ ] C. Providing detailed development specs and guidelines to the development team.
* [*] D. Interacting with stakeholders to learn how to represent their needs in the Product Backlog.
* [ ] E. Creating both functional and non-functional tests to validate the Increment meets the definition of Done.

--
****

[#answer]

The correct answers are A and D.

[#explanation]
--
The Product Owner must order the Product Backlog so that developers know which items provide the most value. If possible, the Product Owner will negotiate with the team to ensure these items get developed first.

Also, according to the Scrum Guide, "The Product Owner may represent the needs of many stakeholders in the Product Backlog." So interacting with and collaborating with stakeholders is important.

Scrum doesn't work if there isn't buy-in from the entire organization, including management.

How do members of the management group in an organization that sponsors a development project support a Scrum Team?
--

[#list]
--
* [*] A. The organization empowers the Scrum Team to manage their own work.
* [ ] B. The organization responds quickly to daily status updates from the Scrum Master.
* [*] C. The organization must provide Scrum Teams with resources that allow for continual improvement.
* [*] D. The organization fully respects and trusts the Product Owner's decisions.

--
****

[#answer]

The correct answers are A, C and D.

[#explanation]
--
Status updates are antithetical to the Scrum Framework. Scrum provides other artifacts and mechanisms to allow for transparency and openness into the progress of the Scrum Team.

Providing sufficient input and resources for the Scrum Team to improve, allowing the Scrum Team to manage their own work, and respecting the decisions of the Scrum Master are three concrete ways an organization can support teams that practice the Scrum Framework

Self-organization and self-management are two important attributes of a Scrum Team.

What is most important criteria for developers to think about when they self-organize into development teams?
--

[#list]
--
* [ ] A. Does each team have a strong and competent team lead?
* [ ] B. Is there a good balance of senior and junior developers?
* [ ] C. Will each team be able to form a sub-group for QA and testing?
* [*] D. Will the team have the cross-functional skills needed to build the product?

--
****

[#answer]

The correct answer is D.

[#explanation]
--
There are not subteams, titles or hierarchies on Scrum Teams.

All that matters when a group of Scrum developers is assembled is whether they have, or do they have the ability to acquire, the cross-functional skills matrix needed to build the product under development and achieve the Product Goal.

From the Scrum Guide: "Within a Scrum Team, there are no sub-teams or hierarchies. It is a cohesive unit of professionals focused on one objective at a time, the Product Goal. Scrum Teams are cross-functional, meaning the members have all the skills necessary to create value each Sprint. They are also self-managing, meaning they internally decide who does what, when, and how."

When should new developers be added to a Scrum team?
--

[#list]
--
* [ ] A. During Sprint Zero the team size should be set for the duration of the project.
* [ ] B. After the current Sprint ends but before the next Sprint begins.
* [*] C. When hiring a new developer will help development continue at a sustainable pace.
* [ ] D. When the Project Manager provides enough budget money for a new developer.

--
****

[#answer]

The correct answer is C.

[#explanation]
--
A new developer can be added to a project at any point in time. There is no rule barring a developer from joining a Scrum team during Sprint Planning, the Sprint Retrospective or even half-way through a Sprint.

Sustainable development is an important Agile principle. Developers should always be challenged and motivated, but they should never be overworked. If a new developer needs to be added to the team to maintain sustainable developer, then add them. 

Just keep in mind that onboarding will sometimes reduce the team's productivity in the short-term, as training and orientation for the new hire will likely occupy some of your developer's time.

Scrum practitioners are encouraged to focus on the current Sprint, and while the Product Goal should always be 'top of mind', Scrum does not plan two or three Sprints into the future. This is an example of which Scrum value?
--

[#list]
--
* [ ] A. Courage.
* [ ] B. Respect.
* [*] C. Focus.
* [ ] D. Openness.
* [ ] E. Honesty.

--
****

[#answer]

The correct answer is C.

[#explanation]
--
One of the key principles of Scrum is to maintain a clear focus on the current Sprint and avoid distractions from other work that is not part of the Sprint. This principle of focusing on the Sprint is intended to ensure that the team can deliver high-quality work and achieve its Sprint Goal without being sidetracked by other priorities.

This is also a recognition of the fact that things can change quickly, especially after a Sprint Review or Sprint Retrospective, so planning beyond the current Sprint is often a complete waste of time.

By not looking beyond the current Sprint, the development team is able to maintain  focus and avoid getting distracted by future work that may not be relevant or may change over time. This helps the team to remain agile and respond quickly to changes in the market or in customer needs, since they are not locked into a fixed plan that may become obsolete.

Moreover, the Scrum framework provides regular opportunities to inspect and adapt the work done in the current Sprint, and adjust the backlog accordingly. This allows the team to constantly improve the product and respond to feedback from stakeholders.
