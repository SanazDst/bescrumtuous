[#answer]
B

[#explanation]

This is false.

The Product Owner will represent the interests of many stakeholders, and balance their wants and needs by fairly ordering the Product Backlog.

The Scrum Team can only work on one objective at a time, but the Product Owner will represent many stakeholders while doing that.
