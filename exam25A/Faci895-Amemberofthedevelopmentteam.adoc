In the Scrum framework, the concept of self-management is one of the core principles. Self-management means that the team has the autonomy and responsibility to manage themselves and their work, including their own processes and procedures, without the need for external supervision or micromanagement.

One aspect of self-management is that the team members collectively hold themselves accountable for their performance and for delivering the work that they commit to completing within a given sprint. This means that if a team member is underperforming, it can impact the team's ability to meet their commitments and deliver on their goals.

In such situations, the concept of self-management gives the team the authority to take action and make decisions that are in the best interest of the team and the project. This includes the ability to remove an underperforming member from the team if necessary.

However, it is important to note that this decision should not be taken lightly and should be made collaboratively by the team as a whole. The Scrum Master can also provide guidance and support to the team in these situations to ensure that the decision is made fairly and with the best interests of the team and the project in mind.
