The correct answer is A.

According to the Scrum Guide, "the entire Scrum Team is accountable for creating a valuable, useful Increment every Sprint."The Scrum Guide doesn't actually use the term iteration.Not every item in the Sprint Backlog gets completed in a Sprint. Anything left unfinished at the end of the Sprint goes back into the Product Backlog to potentially be added into the next Sprint.

[#answer]

The correct answers are A, C and D.

[#explanation]
--
When multiple Scrum Teams are working together on the same project, they will share the same Product Goal, Product Backlog and Product Owner. However, the Sprint Goal will be unique to each team, as each team will have their own, unique Sprint Backlog to work on.

All increments should be integrated together throughout the Sprint and certainly before the end of the Sprint so that the results can be properly inspected, and new items can be selected from the Product Backlog without conflict or repeating work.

[#answer]

The correct answers are A and C.

[#explanation]
--
It is important to integrate Increments together before the end of the Sprint so that the work completed can be properly inspected during the Sprint Review, and so the Scrum Teams know what work has been completed as the Sprint Planning event takes place.
