=== Artifacts Quiz Answers

==== Question 1

****

Which of the following are Scrum artifacts?

* [ ] a) Product Goal
* [*] b) Sprint Backlog
* [ ] c) Spring Goal
* [*] d) Product Backlog
* [*] e) The Increment
* [ ] f) The Definition of Done

****

Options B, D and E are correct.

The three Scrum artifacts are:

- The Sprint Backlog
- The Product Backlog
- The Increment

The other items listed are the commitments made to each of the artifacts, nameley:

- The Sprint Goal is the commitment of the Sprint Backlog
- The Product Goal is the commitment of the Product Backlog
- The Definition of Done is the commitment of the Increment

==== Question 2

****

Every Sprint in Scrum is expected to create at least one usable increment.

Who is accountable for ensuring the Increment is created?

* [x] a) The Development Team
* [*] b) The Scrum Master
* [x] c) The Scrum Team
* [*] de) The Project Manager

****

Option C is correct.

The entire team is accountable for creating a useful Increment each Sprint.

The developers do the work, but the team as a whole is accountable for creating a useful increment, as it plainly stated in the Scrum Guide.

"The entire Scrum Team is accountable for creating a valuable, useful Increment every Sprint."

Note that the developers have a similar, yet different responsibility:

"Developers are the people in the Scrum Team that are committed to creating any aspect of a usable Increment each Sprint."

Stay appraised of the subtle difference between the two, as you may get tested in either direction on the exam.

==== Question 3

****

Which of the following two statements are true about the Sprint Backlog?

* [x] It is a list of all the work planned to be done in the Sprint.
* [ ] Every item has a designated owner.
* [ ] Each task is estimated in either hours or points.
* [x] It is managed by the Scrum developers.
* [ ] It is managed by the Product Owner.

****

Options A and D are correct.

The Sprint Backlog is a key artifact in the Scrum framework, which outlines the work that the Development Team plans to complete during the current Sprint. It is created and managed by the Scrum Developers, who are responsible for delivering the completed product increment at the end of the Sprint.

The Sprint Backlog is managed by the Scrum Developers because they are the ones who are responsible for organizing, planning, and executing the work necessary to deliver a potentially releasable product increment at the end of each Sprint. The Developers have the technical knowledge and skills required to create the plan, estimate the work, and track the progress during the Sprint.

The Sprint Backlog only covers the current Sprint because Scrum is an iterative and incremental framework, which means that the work is completed in short cycles of fixed duration. The Sprint is the time-boxed period during which the Development Team delivers a potentially releasable product increment, and the Sprint Backlog outlines the work that they plan to complete during that time.

By limiting the scope of the Sprint Backlog to the current Sprint, the Scrum Developers can focus on delivering the most valuable work within a fixed time frame. This allows for better planning, collaboration, and flexibility, as the team can adapt to changing requirements or priorities at the end of each Sprint and adjust the plan accordingly.

The Sprint Backlog is managed by the Scrum Developers because they are the ones responsible for delivering the completed product increment at the end of each Sprint. It only covers the current Sprint to enable better planning, collaboration, and flexibility, and to support Scrum's iterative and incremental approach to software development.

==== Question 4

****
According to the Scrum Guide, who is the owner of the Sprint Backlog?

* [ ] The Scrum Team.
* [ ] The Product Owner.
* [ ] The Scrum Master.
* [x] The Development Team.

****
Option D is correct. 

The Development Team owns the Sprint Backlog.

In Scrum, the Development Team is responsible for delivering a potentially releasable increment of the product at the end of each Sprint. The Sprint Backlog is the plan for achieving this goal, and it consists of the work items the Development Team has committed to completing during the Sprint.

The Development Team owns the Sprint Backlog because they are the ones who will be doing the work. They are the experts in the technical aspects of the project and are best positioned to determine what tasks are necessary to deliver the product increment. They have the knowledge and skills required to estimate the effort needed for each item and to determine the order in which they should be completed.

While the Product Owner is responsible for prioritizing the Product Backlog and ensuring that the product increment meets the needs of the stakeholders, they are not responsible for creating or managing the Sprint Backlog. The Product Owner may work with the Development Team to refine the items in the Product Backlog and provide guidance on priorities, but the final decision on what work to include in the Sprint Backlog ultimately lies with the Development Team.

The Scrum Master's role is to facilitate the Scrum process and help the team improve their performance. They are not involved in managing the Sprint Backlog, but they may provide support and guidance to the Development Team as needed.

In summary, the Development Team owns the Sprint Backlog because they are responsible for delivering the product increment and have the technical expertise to plan and execute the work required to achieve that goal. The Product Owner is responsible for prioritizing the Product Backlog and ensuring that the product increment meets the needs of the stakeholders, while the Scrum Master facilitates the Scrum process and helps the team improve their performance.

==== Question 5

****

According to the Scrum Framework, when is the Sprint Goal both created and finalized?

* [ ] The Sprint Goal is created in the prior Sprint during the Sprint Retrospective
* [ ] The Sprint Goal is created before Sprint Planning begins.
* [ ] Scrum creates a Scrum Goal, not a Sprint Goal
* [ ] The Sprint Goal can be created and adjusted any time during the Sprint after Sprint Planning is completed
* [x] The Sprint Goal is created and finalized during Sprint Planning.

****

Option E is correct.

The Sprint Goal is a critical element of the Scrum framework, which is created during Sprint Planning and is intended to guide the Scrum team in their work throughout the Sprint. The Sprint Goal is a concise summary of what the team plans to achieve during the Sprint, which should be aligned with the Product Goal and support the overall product vision.

The Sprint Goal is important because it provides focus and direction to the team, enabling them to make decisions about what work to prioritize and how to approach it. It helps the team to stay aligned and motivated, and it also provides a basis for tracking progress and determining whether the Sprint has been successful.

Once the Sprint Goal is set during Sprint Planning, it should not be changed during the Sprint. This is because the Sprint Goal is intended to provide a clear and stable target for the team to work towards, and changing it mid-Sprint could cause confusion and disrupt the team's focus. If the team determines during the Sprint that they need to change the Sprint Goal due to unforeseen circumstances or new information, they should end the Sprint and conduct a new Sprint Planning session to set a new Sprint Goal that reflects the updated understanding of the work that needs to be done.

In summary, the Sprint Goal is an important aspect of Scrum because it provides a clear and stable target for the team to work towards during the Sprint. It cannot be changed during the Sprint to ensure that the team remains focused and aligned throughout the Sprint.
