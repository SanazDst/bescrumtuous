Scrum demands that you follow the steps and processes that are outlined in the Scrum Guide. And if you skip certain steps, then what you are doing is not Scrum."The Scrum framework, as outlined herein, is immutable. While implementing only parts of Scrum is possible, the result is not Scrum. Scrum exists only in its entirety and functions well as a container for other techniques, methodologies, and practices." -TSG, page 13

Scrum is considered by many to be an Agile methodology, but you will not find the term Agile anywhere in the Scrum Guide. References to Agile on the PSMI exam are typically wrong.Agile methodologies are the opposite of Waterfall, so Waterfall is definitely incorrect.Scrum is not based on mysticism.Scrum is based on Lean Thinking and empiricism."Scrum is founded on empiricism and lean thinking. Empiricism asserts that knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is observed. Lean thinking reduces waste and focuses on the essentials."
