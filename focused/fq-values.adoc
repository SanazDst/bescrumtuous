Option C is correct.

By ensuring the Development Team adheres to their definition of "Done" the Product Owner can have confidence when delivering product increment that it meets all the established quality criteria and is of the highest quality.

The Product Owner wants the Scrum Development Team to adhere to the definition of "Done" for several reasons:

Ensuring a shared understanding: The definition of "Done" is an agreed-upon set of criteria that defines what it means to complete a user story or product increment. By adhering to this definition, the Product Owner can ensure that the entire Scrum Team has a shared understanding of what is expected from each development effort.

Transparency: The definition of "Done" is a way to make the work of the Scrum Development Team transparent. It provides a clear picture of what has been accomplished, and what work remains to be done. This transparency allows the Product Owner to make informed decisions about the product backlog, and to adjust priorities if necessary.

Improved quality: Adhering to the definition of "Done" ensures that the product increment is of high quality. By completing each user story to the agreed-upon criteria, the Scrum Development Team is ensuring that the product is ready for release and that there are no hidden technical debt or issues.

Adhering to the definition of "Done" is essential for ensuring a shared understanding, transparency, high quality, and reliable forecasts, all of which are critical for the success of the Scrum Team and the product they are building.

==== Question 2

****

Which of the following actions will result in diminished trust and transparency between the stakeholders and the Scrum Team.

* [ ] Not completing every item in the Sprint Backlog before the end of the Sprint.
* [ ] Using downtime during the Sprint to study new technologies.
* [ ] Failing to properly estimate the correct number of points for a Product Backlog Item.
* [ ] Marking an increment as complete before it meets the definition of done.


****

Option D is correct.

In Scrum, the Definition of Done is an important concept that helps ensure that each Product Backlog Item (PBI) meets the team's agreed-upon quality standards. When a PBI is marked complete without meeting the Definition of Done, it can hurt transparency and trust between the Scrum team and its stakeholders in a few ways:

It can result in misleading metrics: If a PBI is marked as complete when it doesn't meet the Definition of Done, it can give stakeholders a false sense of progress or completion. This can lead to inaccurate metrics, such as velocity or burn-down charts, which can impact the team's ability to plan and estimate future work.

It can result in rework or technical debt: If a PBI is marked as complete without meeting the Definition of Done, it can result in rework or technical debt down the line. This can impact the team's ability to deliver high-quality work and can lead to delays and decreased productivity.

It can damage trust and transparency: If stakeholders discover that a PBI has been marked as complete without meeting the Definition of Done, it can damage trust and transparency between the Scrum team and its stakeholders. Stakeholders may feel that the team is not being transparent about the work that has been done, which can lead to communication breakdowns and decreased collaboration.

To avoid these issues, it's important for the Scrum team to ensure that each PBI meets the Definition of Done before marking it as complete. This helps to maintain transparency and trust between the Scrum team and its stakeholders and ensures that work is delivered to a high standard of quality.

==== Question 3

****

Which of the following is not a Scrum pillar?

* [ ] Transparency
* [ ] Commitment
* [ ] Adaptation
* [ ] Inspection
* [ ] Openness


****

Options B and E are correct.

==== Question 4

****

Always working to the best of your abilities in order to achieve the Sprint Goal, and providing assistance to others team members when they struggle, demonstrates which one of the five Scrum values in action?

* [ ] Emotional stability.
* [ ] Openness.
* [ ] Focus
* [ ] Extraversion
* [ ] Commitment

****

Option E is correct.

Always working to the best of your abilities to achieve the Sprint Goal shows an ongoing commitment to your team, as does helping others when needed.

Extraversion and emotional stability are not actually Scrum Values.

The five Scrum values are:

Commitment: The Scrum Team commits to achieving its goals and delivering high-quality work. Commitment means that team members hold themselves accountable for their work and take responsibility for delivering what they promised.

Courage: Scrum requires courage to make difficult decisions, to admit mistakes, and to challenge the status quo. The team must be willing to take risks and face their fears to achieve their goals.

Focus: Scrum teams focus on the work that needs to be done to achieve their goals. They prioritize their work and minimize distractions to deliver the most value.

Openness: The Scrum Team practices openness, transparency, and honesty with each other and stakeholders. They share information, progress, and challenges openly and seek feedback to improve.

Respect: Scrum teams treat each other with respect, recognizing the unique contributions of each team member. They create a safe environment where everyone can share their ideas and opinions without fear of judgment.

These values are important because they provide a foundation for a collaborative and productive team environment. When Scrum teams embrace these values, they build trust, increase communication, and work more effectively together. By committing to their goals, being courageous, focusing on their work, practicing openness, and showing respect to each other, Scrum teams can deliver high-quality products and continuously improve.

==== Question 5

****

Which of the following best describes the goal of the Sprint Review?

* [ ] To inspect the increment of work delivered with the participation of stakeholders.
* [ ] To discuss how well the Scrum theory and Scrum principles were applied during the Sprint.
* [ ] To introspect on the team's performance during the previous Sprint.
* [ ] To collect feedback from interested parties so the team can adapt their plan towards achieving the product goal in the next Sprint.


****

The goal of the Sprint Review in Scrum is to inspect the increment of work completed by the team during the Sprint and to gather feedback from stakeholders. This helps the team to adapt their plan for the next Sprint and to ensure that the product continues to meet the needs of the stakeholders.

During the Sprint Review, the Scrum team demonstrates the work that they completed during the Sprint and gathers feedback from the stakeholders, including the Product Owner and other interested parties. The feedback received during the review helps the team to adapt their plan for the next Sprint and to ensure that they are continuing to deliver value to the stakeholders.

Here are a few ways that the feedback gathered during the Sprint Review can be used to adapt the Scrum team's plan for the next Sprint:

Prioritization of work: Based on the feedback received during the Sprint Review, the Product Owner may decide to adjust the priority of items in the Product Backlog to better reflect the needs of the stakeholders.

Changes to the product: The feedback received during the Sprint Review may reveal opportunities to improve the product or to add new features that better meet the needs of the stakeholders. The team can then adjust their plan for the next Sprint to incorporate these changes.

Process improvement: The feedback gathered during the Sprint Review can also reveal areas where the team can improve their processes or better collaborate with stakeholders. The team can then make adjustments to their working practices during the next Sprint to address these areas of improvement.

Overall, the goal of the Sprint Review in Scrum is to gather feedback from stakeholders and to use that feedback to adapt the Scrum team's plan for the next Sprint. This helps to ensure that the product continues to meet the needs of the stakeholders and that the team is delivering value with each iteration of development work.
