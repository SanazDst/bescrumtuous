== Self-Managed Teams Quiz

One of the 13 tested categories on the Scrum Master exam is 'Self-Managed Teams.'

The following questions will give you an idea of the scope and difficulty of these exam questions.

==== Question 1

****
You, the Scrum Master, have been told that the quality assurance (QA) tests performed by an external team have been delayed, and due to this delay, it's unlikely the Definition of Done will be achieved before the end of this 3-week Sprint. However, if the Sprint was extended a week, the QA work would likely be done. 

How would you proceed as a Scrum Master? (Choose 2)

* [ ] Extend the Sprint a week to allow QA to complete their work.
* [ ] Investigate why the Scrum Team does not have all the cross-functional skills to achieve the Definition of Done without an external QA team
* [ ] Remove QA work from the Definition of Done for this Sprint.
* [ ] Explain to the organization that Scrum is not designed to manage the work performed by people external to the Scrum Team.
* [ ] Turn the next Sprint into a 'Performance and Security' sprint and focus on these two non-functional aspects of the code.

****

==== Question 5

****

Your organization just hired 30 React programmers to build a responsive mobile app for your product.

As the newly appointed Scrum Master for the project, what advice would you give the team as the developers organize themselves into smaller teams?

****

A Scrum Team must have all of the skills necessary to complete the Definition of Done. The Scrum Team cannot outsource work that is part of their Definition of Done and still have that work managed through Scrum.

Extending the Sprint is never an option. The Sprint length is fixed when the Sprint starts.

The Definition of Done can always be discussed and updated. However, the Scrum Master does not have the right to unilaterally change the Definition of Done, and changes to the Definition of Done are best discussed in the Sprint Retrospective.

Furthermore, the Definition of Done should not be changed midway through a Sprint to accommodate moving goalposts. Doing so would be antithetical to Scrum.

****

The Scrum Team should work together, as a whole, to create a product that provides full end-to-end functionality within the requirements of the Product Backlog and the Definition of Done.

There are no sub-teams in Scrum, nor are their leaders or managers. 

"Within a Scrum Team, there are no sub-teams or hierarchies. They are also self-managing, meaning they internally decide who does what, when, and how."

==== Question 3

****

* [ ] The Development Team can outsource work they are not qualified to produce to third parties or other qualified Scrum Teams.
* [ ] The Development Team is made up of programmers, architects, testers, DevOps professionals etc.
* [ ] The Scrum Team is responsible for all product-related activities.
* [ ] The team members have all the skills necessary to create value each Sprint.

****

The correct options, C and D, come right out of the Scrum Guide:

"Scrum Teams are cross-functional, meaning the members have all the skills necessary to create value each Sprint... 

The Scrum Team is responsible for all product-related activities from stakeholder collaboration, verification, maintenance, operation, experimentation, research and development, and anything else that might be required."

==== Question 4

****

What are three advantages of having teams that are self-managed and self-organized?

* [ ] Improved innovation.
* [ ] Improved commitment to Scrum and its goals.
* [ ] Improved precision in projections.
* [ ] Improved self-accountability across the team.
* [ ] Improved adherence to industry regulations.

****

A, B and D are correct.

Increased creativity  is a common benefit of self-organization because it allows team members to leverage their skills and experience to come up with new and innovative ideas. 

Increased self-accountability is another benefit of self-organization because it empowers team members to take ownership of their work and hold themselves accountable for their results. Increased commitment is also a benefit of self-organization because it can create a sense of shared ownership and responsibility for the team's success, leading to greater motivation and dedication among team members.

Increased rule compliance is more closely related to a command-and-control management style, where rules and regulations are enforced from the top down. Increased accuracy of estimates is more related to project management techniques and has less to do with the team's ability to self-organize.

Your organization just hired 30 React programmers to build a responsive mobile app for your product.

As the newly appointed Scrum Master for the project, what advice would you give the team as the developers organize themselves into smaller teams?

* [ ] Teams should have developers who possess specialized skills, and those developers will concentrate on Product Backlog Items associated with their specific problem domain.
* [ ] Teams should be composed of developers with skills from many domains, which allows the team to be accountable for solutions that cover the product features from beginning to end.

* [ ] With only one Scrum Master, there should only be one team that is composed of sub-groups with each group having a general set of cross-domain skills.


****

Option B is correct.

There are several reasons why it's beneficial for a Scrum team to have developers with multi-domain skills, rather than a bunch of developers with specialized skills that focus on a specific tier in the development stack:

Improved Collaboration: When developers have multi-domain skills, they can better understand the work being done by their colleagues in different areas of the development stack. This leads to improved collaboration and communication between team members, as they are better equipped to understand and work with each other.

Greater Flexibility: Multi-domain developers are more versatile and can more easily adapt to changes in the project, as they are able to work on different parts of the stack as needed. This provides the team with greater flexibility and allows them to respond more quickly to changing requirements or new features.

More Efficient Problem-Solving: Multi-domain developers can also more easily identify and troubleshoot issues that may arise across the different tiers of the development stack. They can see how the various components of the system interact with one another and identify potential problems more quickly, leading to faster resolutions.

Increased Innovation: Developers with multi-domain skills are also more likely to come up with innovative solutions and ideas. By having a broader understanding of the entire system, they can more easily identify areas for improvement and suggest new approaches that may not have been considered by specialists working in their specific domain.

Overall, having developers with multi-domain skills on a Scrum team can lead to a more cohesive and efficient team, with a better understanding of the entire development process, improved collaboration and communication, greater flexibility, and increased innovation.

Note that there are no sub-teams in Scrum. Everyone in Scrum is equal. There are no QA sub-groups or testing sub-teams in Scrum.

Also, a Scrum Master can work with multiple teams at the same time. A Scrum Master does not have to commit 100% of their time to a single team.
