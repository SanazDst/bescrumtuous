[#answer]

The correct answers are A and D.

[#explanation]
--
A cross functional team in the software development domain will possess the skills to build and test components from end-to-end.

A Scrum Team will not outsource Product Backlot items to an external third-party, and responsibilities like user acceptance testing, quality assurance and are done within the team. These tasks are not assigned to sub-teams or external teams. 

The Scrum has the ability to implement Product backlog items from end-to-end. 

"Scrum Teams are cross-functional, meaning the members have all the skills necessary to create value each Sprint." -The Scrum Guide, page 5

[#answer]

The correct answer is B.

[#explanation]
--
The Scrum Team should work together, as a whole, to create a product that provides full end-to-end functionality within the requirements of the Product Backlog and the Definition of Done.

There are no sub-teams in Scrum, nor are their leaders or managers. 

"Within a Scrum Team, there are no sub-teams or hierarchies. They are also self-managing, meaning they internally decide who does what, when, and how."

[#answer]

The correct answer is D.

[#explanation]
--
The Daily Scrum is not a status update and nowhere in the Scrum Guide does it suggest that what happens in the Daily Scrum should be reported to stakeholders.

It is a time for developers to adapt to changes and make changes to the Sprint Backlog if it is necessary to keep the Sprint Goal in focus.

[#explanation]

It is the Developers who select the Product Backlog items to be included in the current Sprint. This is done with input from the Product Owner, but the Developers have the final say."Through discussion with the Product Owner, the Developers select items from the Product Backlog to include in the current Sprint." -The Scrum Guide, page 8

* [ ] The Product Owner
* [ ] The Scrum Master
* [ ] The Development Team
* [*] Nobody

****

[#answer]

The correct answer is D.

[#explanation]
--
Scrum does not grant any of its members to fire another member.

A development team can choose have a developer removed from the team. But this is not the same as firing a developer.

If a development team chooses to remove a member, that is the right they have as a self-organizing team. Whether a company fires that developer, or allocates them to a different team, is not a concern of the Scrum team.
