****

If a Product Backlog item doesn't meet the Definition of Done by the end of the Sprint, which means it's not complete, it goes back into the Product Backlog.


The Scrum Team will then decide if work on the feature should continue during the next Spring, and if so, re-estimate the work needed to complete the undone PBI.

According to the Scrum Guide, the Product Owner is accountable for creating Product Backlog Items, but they do not have to personally create them. They can delegate this responsibility to others.

The Product Owner is also accountable for effective Product Backlog management, which includes:
- Developing and explicitly communicating the Product Goal;
- Creating and clearly communicating Product Backlog items;
- Ordering Product Backlog items; and,
- Ensuring that the Product Backlog is transparent, visible and understood.
The Product Owner may do the above work or may delegate the responsibility to others. Regardless, the Product Owner remains accountable.

==== Question 3

****

Five teams working separately to build the same product should maintain separate Product Backlogs.

* [ ] True
* [ ] False

****

False

When multiple Scrum teams are working on the same project, they are typically working towards a common goal or set of objectives. Each team may have their own specific area of responsibility or focus, but ultimately they are all working towards the same end product.

Using a single Product Backlog for all teams ensures that everyone is working from the same set of priorities and requirements. This helps to avoid duplication of effort and ensures that each team is working on the most important items at any given time. It also provides a clear and consistent view of progress across all teams and allows for better collaboration and coordination between teams.

In addition, having a shared Product Backlog encourages a cross-functional approach to development, where teams work together to deliver working software in small increments, and are focused on delivering value to the customer. This can help to improve the overall quality of the product and reduce the time to market.

Overall, using a single Product Backlog for multiple Scrum teams is an effective way to ensure alignment, focus, and collaboration across the entire development effort.

Option C is correct.

The Scrum Master is a coach and facilitator, and it is the Scrum Master's job to coach and motivate members of the Scrum Team when they need guidance or direction as it pertains to implementing the directives, roles and accountabilities as described within the Scrum Guide.

The Scrum Master has the responsibility to support and help the team, including the Product Owner, to maximize the value delivered by the product. If the Scrum Master sees the Product Owner struggling with the task of ordering the Product Backlog, there are several actions they can take to assist:

Coach the Product Owner: The Scrum Master can provide coaching to the Product Owner on effective Product Backlog management practices, such as prioritization techniques, user story writing, and backlog refinement sessions. They can also provide guidance on how to involve stakeholders in the prioritization process and how to manage dependencies between Product Backlog items.

Encourage Feedback: The Scrum Master can encourage the Product Owner to seek feedback from stakeholders and the development team on the order of the Product Backlog items. This feedback can help the Product Owner refine the prioritization and ensure that the team is aligned with the product vision.

Just remember, it's not the Scrum Master's job to do the work of the Product Owner. The order of the product backlog, which is critically important to ensure maximum value gets delivered during development, is the responsibility of the PO.

The Scrum Master's role is to support the team and help them to achieve their goals. By providing coaching, facilitating collaborative sessions, and providing insights and feedback, the Scrum Master can help the Product Owner to effectively prioritize and manage the Product Backlog.

Options D and E are correct.

In Scrum, the Product Backlog is the single, prioritized list of items that define what needs to be done to achieve the project's goal. The Product Owner is responsible for managing the Product Backlog, ensuring that it is constantly refined and prioritized, and that the development team has a clear understanding of what needs to be built and why.

When multiple teams are working on the same Scrum project, it is important for them to share a common Product Backlog and a common Product Owner for several reasons:

Consistency: By having a common Product Backlog and Product Owner, all teams are working towards the same set of goals and priorities. This ensures that everyone is on the same page and working towards the same objectives.

Collaboration: By sharing a common Product Backlog and Product Owner, teams can collaborate more easily and share information more effectively. They can work together to refine and prioritize the backlog, ensuring that it reflects the needs of all stakeholders.

Alignment: When each team has its own backlog and Product Owner, it can be difficult to ensure that everyone is aligned and working towards the same goals. By having a common backlog and Product Owner, the entire organization is more likely to work towards the same objectives.

Efficiency: A common backlog and Product Owner can also help to improve the efficiency of the development process. Teams can work together to identify dependencies and plan their work more effectively, avoiding duplication of effort and ensuring that everyone is working on the most important tasks.

Overall, sharing a common Product Backlog and Product Owner is an essential aspect of successful Scrum projects with multiple teams. It helps to ensure consistency, collaboration, alignment, and efficiency, and enables the organization to work together more effectively towards its goals.
