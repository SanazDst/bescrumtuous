=== Product Value Quiz Answers


==== Question 1  

****

What is discussed in the Sprint Review?

* [ ] The effectiveness of the Scrum process as it was implemented.
* [ ] Software development best practices
* [ ] The value delivered in the current Sprint
* [ ] The Sprint Goal for the next Sprint


****

The purpose of the Sprint Review in Scrum is to review the value delivered the current Sprint and examine the product increment that was developed during the Sprint to the Product Owner, stakeholders, and other members of the organization. 

The Sprint Review is a time-boxed event that takes place at the end of the sprint, and the Scrum team uses this opportunity to get feedback and insights from stakeholders on the product increment.

The Sprint Review provides the following benefits to the Scrum team:

Transparency: The Sprint Review provides transparency into the progress that has been made during the sprint and allows stakeholders to see the product increment and provide feedback.

Feedback: The Sprint Review provides a valuable opportunity to get feedback from stakeholders on the product increment that has been developed during the sprint. This feedback can be used to inform future sprints and help the team to prioritize the backlog.

Collaboration: The Sprint Review encourages collaboration between the Scrum team and stakeholders. This collaboration can lead to better communication and alignment between the team and stakeholders.

Continuous Improvement: The Sprint Review helps the team to continuously improve by identifying areas for improvement in the product, process, or team dynamics.

The Sprint Review is a crucial part of the Scrum framework and plays a significant role in ensuring that the product increment meets the needs of the customer and provides value to the organization.

==== Question 2

****

According to the Scrum Guide, which of the following is true about the Increment?

* [ ] Each new Increment gets added to all the prior Increments
* [ ] An Increment doesn't have to be usable.
* [ ] Only one Increment can be created per Sprint.
* [ ] An Increment must be compatible and work with all previous increments.
* [ ]An Increment is a concrete stepping stone toward the Product Goal.

****

Options A, D and E are correct. 

An increment must be usable and and multiple increments can be created per Sprint, which makes those two options wrong.

The correct options come directly out of the Scrum Guide's definition of a Sprint:

"An Increment is a concrete stepping stone toward the Product Goal. Each Increment is additive to all prior Increments and thoroughly verified, ensuring that all Increments work together. In order to provide value, the Increment must be usable."

==== Question 3

****
Which of the following are qualities and characteristics of a successful development team in Scrum?


* [ ] They are budget conscious and complete work within given cost allocations
* [ ] They always respect the Definition of Done when they turn Product Backlog Items into potentially releasable increments of value
* [ ] They know their limits and delegate difficult work that requires special testing or quality control skills to an external team
* [ ] They know not to communicate directly with customers or stakeholders


****

Option B is correct.

Budget should not be a concern of the developers. Developers should never be asked to bargain away quality in order to meet a financial budget.

Also, developers are expected to have all of the required skills in-house to complete the Definition of Done, so they should not be delegating work to external teams.

Respecting the Definition of Done and turning Product Backlog Items into usable Increments of value is the job of a development team.

Nothing in Scrum forbids developers from talking to customers or stakeholders.

* [ ] It is a time for the Scrum Team and stakeholders to inspect the incremental value added during the Sprint and talk about out where to focus next
* [ ] It is a tool used by management and executives to dictate the Development Team's focus for the next Sprint
* [ ] It is a demonstration the developers put on to show everything they worked on during the Sprint
* [ ] The Sprint Review is designed to reward productive teams with accolades, or punish underperforming teams with reprimands

****

The Sprint Review is where a development team shows stakeholders items that were completed and met the definition of done. The team demonstrates the value they created.

The Sprint Review is not a 'demo', and it is not a time to show everything the team worked on. Items not completed are not discussed at the Sprint Review.

What is the best way to ensure security and protection of the occupant are prioritized?

* [ ] Outsource security and protection concerns to an external third party that specializes in these areas.
* [ ] Add a Sprint prior to the release of the car that deals exclusively with security and protection.
* [ ] Build a special sub-team on the development team that deals exclusively with security and protection of the occupant.
* [ ] Have the Product Owner add the features that pertain to security and protection of the occupant to the Product Backlog.
* [ ] Add concerns related to the security and protection of the occupant to the Definition of Done.

****

We don't outsource work in Scrum, nor do we create sub-teams. 

From the Scrum Guide: "Scrum Teams are cross-functional, meaning the members have all the skills necessary to create value each Sprint. Within a Scrum Team, there are no sub-teams or hierarchies. It is a cohesive unit of professionals focused on one objective at a time, the Product Goal."

In Scrum, we deal with non-functional requirements by either adding Product Backlog Items that address these concerns, and we add non-functional criteria to the Definition of Done.

==== Question 6

****

The Scrum Development team is building a house, and the requirements for how the bathroom should be laid out are unclear. What should the Scrum Developers do?

* [ ] Outsource the building of the bathroom to a third party.
* [ ] Ask the Product Owner for clarification on the requirements.
* [ ] Ask the Scrum Master to seek clarification of the requirements from the home builder.
* [ ] Scrum cannot be used outside of software development.


****
Scrum isn't just for software development.

In fact, a good strategy on the Scrum Master Certification exam is to reframe a question as though it was in the construction domain or the manufacturing domain.

If a team of construction workers building a house weren't clear on how to finish the bathroom, they'd consult the homeowner, or at least the person trusted to clarify the requirements. In that scenario, the construction workers would be the developers, and the home owner or builder would be the Product Owner.

The correct answer? Have the developers seek clarification from the Product Owner with regards to requirements.
