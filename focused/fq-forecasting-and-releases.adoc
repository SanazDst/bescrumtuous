== Forecasting and Release Planning Quiz


One of the 13 tested categories on the Scrum Master exam is 'Forecasting and Release Planning.'

These five questions will give you an idea of the scope and difficulty of these exam questions.

==== Question 1

****

What does the slope of the line in a burndown chart demonstrate?

* [ ] The evolution over time of the money spent on the project.
* [ ] When all work will be completed so the Scrum Team can be released for other work.
* [ ] When the work remaining will likely be completed if nothing changes on the Product Backlog or the Development Team.
* [ ] When the project will be over if the Product Owner removes work that is equal in effort to any new work that is added.

****

* [ ] A Product Backlog Item is complete when a Quality Assurance team verifies that the work passes all acceptance criteria, making it ready for release
* [ ] A Product Backlog Item is complete when all work in the Sprint Backlog related to the item is finished, making it ready for release


****

'''

==== Question 5

****

What are the skills and capabilities the Scrum Development Team should have in order to ensure effective performance throughout the Sprint?

* [ ] The ability to decompose Product Backlog items (PBIs) and progressively create Increments of Work until a functional release is possible.
* [ ] The ability to perform all of the core software development work, with the exception of any specialized testing that would require additional tools and staging environments.
* [ ] The ability to complete a development project within budget and within the timeline agreed upon with the Product Owner.

Option C is correct.

A trend line through a release burndown chart indicates how fast work is being completed relative to the original plan, and can help visualize progress toward completion of a Release Goal.

The Scrum Guide only makes a short reference to burndown charts, and even then, it says they are not a replacement for empiricism.

You don't need to be a burndown chart expert. But knowing what one is will keep you from being caught off guard on the Scrum certification exam.

==== Question 2

****
Who has final say over how work will be scheduled and performed during a Sprint?


* [ ] The Stakeholders.
* [ ] The Project Manager.
* [ ] The Product Owner.
* [ ] The Scrum Master.
* [ ] The Development Team.

****

The answer is E.

In Scrum, the development team is responsible for planning and executing the work during a Sprint. The Scrum framework is designed to be a collaborative process where the development team works closely with the Product Owner to ensure that the work being done is aligned with the project's goals and priorities.

The development team is the only group of people who have a say over how work will be scheduled during a Sprint because they are the ones who are actually doing the work. They are the ones who are responsible for estimating the effort required to complete each item in the Sprint backlog and for deciding how to organize the work within the Sprint.

This allows the development team to take ownership of the work and to have the autonomy to decide how to best organize their work in a way that allows them to be as efficient and effective as possible. This also ensures that the development team is able to focus on the work that they have committed to completing during the Sprint, without being distracted by external pressures or competing priorities.

What effects would be observed on the original Scrum Team when two additional Scrum Teams are included in the development process for the same product?

* [ ] The original Scrum team's productivity is likely to decrease slightly.
* [ ] The original Scrum team's productivity is likely to stay the same.
* [ ] The original Scrum team's productivity is likely to increase slightly.
* [ ] Each team's productivity will be the same as the original Scrum Team

The original Scrum Team might experience a period of reduced productivity as the teams become accustom to working together, but over the medium term the collective productivity of all the teams should increase.

There are several potential reasons why the productivity of a Scrum team might decrease when new members are added:

Forming and Storming: When new members are added to a Scrum team, the team must go through the "forming" and "storming" stages of group development, where they are getting to know each other and figuring out how to work together effectively. This process can take time and can be disruptive to the team's productivity.

Communication: Effective communication is essential for a successful Scrum team. When new members are added, the team's communication channels can become disrupted, leading to misunderstandings, delays, and other issues that can impact productivity.

Skill levels: New team members may not have the same level of skill and experience as existing team members, which can lead to imbalances in workload and delays as new members get up to speed. In some cases, existing team members may need to spend time coaching and training new members, taking away from their own productivity.

Disruption to processes: Introducing new team members can also disrupt established processes and ways of working, which can lead to confusion and delays.

Team dynamics: Finally, adding new members can disrupt team dynamics and the relationships between team members, leading to potential conflicts and interpersonal issues that can negatively impact productivity.

To mitigate these issues, it's important to onboard new team members effectively, including providing adequate training and support, and to communicate clearly with the team about the changes and the expectations for the team going forward. It's also important to ensure that new team members are a good fit for the team culture and to actively work to manage team dynamics during the transition period.

==== Question 4

****

When is a Product Backlog Item (PBI) considered fully complete and ready for release?

* [ ]  A Product Backlog Item is complete when it is associated with a single, completed Increment of Work that meets the Definition of Done, making the PBI ready for release
* [ ] A Product Backlog Item is complete when further Increments of Work on it are no longer possible, making it ready for release.
* [ ] A Product Backlog Item is complete when a Quality Assurance team verifies that the work passes all acceptance criteria, making it ready for release
* [ ] A Product Backlog Item is complete when all work in the Sprint Backlog related to the item is finished, making it ready for release


****

Option A is correct.

A Product Backlog Item is complete when all of its features are completed and it is not possible to create any further increments of work on it.

A Product Backlog Item is not necessarily associated with a single Increment of Work. A PBI may last for multiple Sprints, with each Sprint producing an Increment of Work that meets a Definition of Done for a given facet of a Product Backlog Item. That's why PBIs are decomposed by the development team - to break it up into manageable pieces of work.

==== Question 5

****

What are the skills and capabilities the Scrum Development Team should have in order to ensure effective performance throughout the Sprint?

* [ ] The ability to decompose Product Backlog items (PBIs) and progressively create Increments of Work until a functional release is possible.
* [ ] The ability to perform all of the core software development work, with the exception of any specialized testing that would require additional tools and staging environments.
* [ ] The ability to complete a development project within budget and within the timeline agreed upon with the Product Owner.
* [ ] The ability to read burndown charts and work with Kanban boards.

****

The Scrum Development team must be able to decompose a PBI and create as many Increments of Work that are necessary to complete the PBI and make the item ready for release.

A Product Backlog Item (PBI) is a high-level user story or requirement that represents a feature, function, or other unit of work that needs to be delivered in order to meet the product's goals. Decomposing a PBI means breaking it down into smaller, more manageable pieces of work that can be completed by the Scrum development team during a sprint.

The process of decomposing a PBI involves analyzing it in more detail, identifying the sub-tasks, dependencies, and other factors involved, and then creating smaller PBIs that can be individually prioritized, estimated, and worked on by the team. This allows the team to better understand the requirements of the PBI and the work involved, which in turn helps with planning and delivering the work effectively.

Decomposition is an ongoing process throughout the Scrum framework. As the team progresses through the sprint, they may discover additional details or dependencies that require further decomposition of PBIs, or they may need to adjust their plan based on feedback from stakeholders or changes in the product's requirements. By continually decomposing PBIs, the team can ensure they have a clear understanding of the work involved and can prioritize, estimate, and deliver the product backlog items more effectively.
