****

Option C is correct.

Coaching and teaching are important parts of the Scrum Master's role as a servant-leader.

Active listening and open questioning are important skills in effective communication, particularly in Scrum and other agile frameworks where collaboration and continuous feedback are key. However, there are other techniques and approaches that can also be useful in communication, including:

Reflective listening: This involves reflecting back what the speaker has said to demonstrate that you understand their message. For example, "So what I hear you saying is that you're concerned about the timeline for this project."

Summarizing: This involves summarizing what has been said to ensure that everyone is on the same page. For example, "Let me make sure I understand - you're saying that we need to focus on improving the user experience for this feature."

Paraphrasing: This involves restating what has been said in your own words to show that you understand and to encourage clarification. For example, "If I'm understanding you correctly, you're suggesting that we approach this problem from a different angle."

Nonverbal communication: This includes using body language, eye contact, and facial expressions to show that you are engaged and paying attention.

Visualization: This involves using diagrams, sketches, or other visual aids to help communicate ideas and concepts.

Silence: Sometimes, allowing a pause in the conversation can give the speaker time to gather their thoughts and provide a more thoughtful response.

While active listening and open questioning are valuable techniques in communication, incorporating these alternatives can help to build trust and improve collaboration in a Scrum team.

==== Question 4

****

The Scrum Developers have just informed you that the consensus is that the developer needs to be removed from the team.

What should you do as a Scrum Master?


* [ ] Facilitate team building activities to help the underperforming developer integrate better with the team.
* [ ] Coach the development team on ways to improve communication between peers and help everyone on the team get along.
* [ ] Help the team remove the unwanted developer and coach them on ways to do it in a manner that is fair and respectful.
* [ ] Inform the development team that they do not have the authority to remove members from the team.


****

In the Scrum framework, the concept of self-management is one of the core principles. Self-management means that the team has the autonomy and responsibility to manage themselves and their work, including their own processes and procedures, without the need for external supervision or micromanagement.

One aspect of self-management is that the team members collectively hold themselves accountable for their performance and for delivering the work that they commit to completing within a given sprint. This means that if a team member is underperforming, it can impact the team's ability to meet their commitments and deliver on their goals.

In such situations, the concept of self-management gives the team the authority to take action and make decisions that are in the best interest of the team and the project. This includes the ability to remove an underperforming member from the team if necessary.

However, it is important to note that this decision should not be taken lightly and should be made collaboratively by the team as a whole. The Scrum Master can also provide guidance and support to the team in these situations to ensure that the decision is made fairly and with the best interests of the team and the project in mind.

==== Question 5

****
Which of the following actions should the Scrum Master never do?


* [ ] Tell the Scrum Developers how to self-manage.
* [ ] Extend the length of the Sprint.
* [ ] End the Sprint early.
* [ ] Coach the Development Team to ensure the Daily Scrum is time-boxed to 15 minutes.


****

Options A, B and C are correct because they are not correct.

The Scrum Master is a servant-leader and should never 'tell' the developers what to do. The Scrum Master coaches and facilitates and allows developers to discover solutions and solve problems themselves.

Furthermore, the Scrum Framework does not allow the length of a Sprint to be extended, and only the Product Owner can end a Sprint early.

The Scrum Master does coach teams about the Scrum Framework, so coaching a team to ensure the 15 minute Daily Scrum timebox is not exceeded is a good use of the Scrum Master's time.
