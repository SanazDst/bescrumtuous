[#answer]

The correct answer is D.

[#explanation]
--
The Sprint Retrospective is the correct time to discuss the Definition of Done and change the DoD if required.

You can't change the DoD prior to the Sprint Retrospective, because work is still being done, and you end up with a scenario where you end up "moving the goalposts" mid-Sprint. Keep in mind that Sprints should be short, so it will never be more than 4 weeks before a new Sprint starts again.

Furthermore, you don't want to negotiate the Definition of Done during Sprint Planning because developers might subconsciously 'game the definition' to make it easier to convert difficult Product Backlog Items to an increment.

Also, there is nothing after one Sprint and before another. There is no time between Sprints in Scrum. 

When one Sprint ends, the next Sprint begins immediately.

[#answer]

The correct answers are B and D.

[#explanation]
--
The Daily Scrum can be held at any time and any location, so long as the time and location don't change.

Also, the three questions of:

What did you do yesterday?
What will you do today?
Are there any blockers or impediments preventing you from doing your work?

Have been removed from the Scrum Guide. These can be used during the Daily Scrum, but they are not required.

"Time boxing" refers to setting a fixed duration for a specific event or activity. This helps the team to work within a defined period and ensures that the team focuses on the most important work and that the meetings are efficient and effective.

Scrum has several time-boxed events, which are:

Sprint: A sprint is a time-boxed period (usually 1-4 weeks) during which the team works to deliver a potentially releasable increment of the product. The sprint helps the team to focus on a set of goals and ensures that the team has a predictable rhythm for delivering work.

Sprint Planning: The sprint planning is a time-boxed meeting at the beginning of each sprint where the team collaborates to determine what work they will commit to delivering during the upcoming sprint. Sprint Planning is timeboxed to a maximum of eight hours for a one-month Sprint. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter.

Daily Scrum: The daily scrum is a time-boxed meeting that occurs each day of the sprint, usually 15 minutes long, during which the team meets to discuss progress, identify any obstacles, and plan their work for the next 24 hours.

Sprint Review: At the end of the sprint, the team holds a sprint review meeting. The Sprint Review is the second to last event of the Sprint and is timeboxed to a maximum of four hours for a one-month Sprint. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter.

Sprint Retrospective: The sprint retrospective is a time-boxed meeting that occurs after the sprint review. The Sprint Retrospective concludes the Sprint. It is timeboxed to a maximum of three hours for a one-month Sprint. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter.

Time boxing helps to keep the team focused and ensures that the meetings do not go on longer than necessary. This is important because it helps to maintain the team's productivity, and also ensures that the team is working efficiently and effectively towards its goals.

The Sprint Review:
--

[#list]
--
* [ ] Is attended by only the Scrum Team
* [*] Is attended by the Scrum Team and stakeholders
* [ ] Is attended by the Scrum Team and everyone in the company so that progress can be evaluated
* [ ] Is attended by only the Scrum Master, Product Owner and the stakeholders

[#answer]

The correct answer is B.

[#explanation]
--
The Sprint Review is attended by all members of the Scrum Team as well as stakeholders who have an interest in the application being developed.

The Sprint Review is not attended by all employees of the company or everyone in the organization. That would not create for a focused and productive meeting.
