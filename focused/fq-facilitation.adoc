[#answer]

The correct answer is C.

[#explanation]
--
The job of the Scrum Master is to coach the team on how Scrum works, which includes making sure they understand terms like the Definition of Done.

A Scrum Master doesn't actually have to attend the Daily Scrum. The Daily Scrum is owned by the developers, and only the developers need to attend. And even when the Scrum Master does attend, they aren't supposed to participate.

Doing performance reviews or setting up bonus plans are not part of the Scrum Master's role.

The correct answers are A and E.

[#explanation]
--
The Scrum Master does not actively participate in the Daily Scrum. The Scrum Master does not ask questions, take notes for the team or instruct any individual to speak.

With regards to the Daily Scrum, the Scrum Master's responsibility is to make sure it is used properly within the context of Scrum, which means coaching around it being self-managed, self-organized and time-boxed to 15 minutes.

From the Scrum Guide: "The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute event for the Developers of the Scrum Team. The Developers can select whatever structure and techniques they want, as long as their Daily Scrum focuses on progress toward the Sprint Goal and produces an actionable plan for the next day of work."

The correct answer is A.

[#explanation]

The are no rules in the Scrum Guide about where or when the daily Scrum takes place. The only rule is that is must take place at the same time and in the same place every day. If developers find it productive to do their Daily Scrum on the Whitehouse lawn, then let them, so long as it doesn't impede their ability to complete their Sprint Goals.

From the Scrum Guide: "The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute event for the Developers of the Scrum Team. To reduce complexity, it is held at the same time and place every working day of the Sprint."

If team members are not communicating effectively, they need to be coached on Scrum Values and the importance of working as a team.This is also an issue to bring up at the Sprint Retrospective. Any time there are communication issues that were not resolved during the Sprint, the Sprint Retrospective is the correct time to discuss them.
