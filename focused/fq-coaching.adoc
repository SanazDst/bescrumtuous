The Scrum Master does not participate in the Daily Scrum, and in fact, the Scrum Guide does not even require that they attend the Daily Scrum.

Also, stakeholders do not attend the Sprint Retrospective. They attend the Sprint Review, but not the retrospective.

The correct options were all taken directly out of the Scrum Guide:

The Scrum Master serves the Scrum Team in several ways, including:
*  Coaching the team members in self-management and cross-functionality;
*  Helping the Scrum Team focus on creating high-value Increments that meet the Definition of Done;
*  Causing the removal of impediments to the Scrum Team?s progress; and,
*  Ensuring that all Scrum events take place and are positive, productive, and kept within the timebox.

The Scrum Master serves the Product Owner in several ways, including:
*  Helping find techniques for effective Product Goal definition and Product Backlog management;
*  Helping the Scrum Team understand the need for clear and concise Product Backlog items;
*  Helping establish empirical product planning for a complex environment; and,
*  Facilitating stakeholder collaboration as requested or needed.

The Scrum Master serves the organization in several ways, including:
*  Leading, training, and coaching the organization in its Scrum adoption;
*  Planning and advising Scrum implementations within the organization;
*  Helping employees and stakeholders understand and enact an empirical approach for complex work; and,
*  Removing barriers between stakeholders and Scrum Teams.

The Scrum Master is responsible for ensuring that the Scrum framework is followed by the team and that the team is continuously improving. Two key aspects of this responsibility are facilitating time-boxed meetings and coaching people on Scrum values.

Time-boxed meetings are a critical aspect of the Scrum framework. They help to ensure that the team stays focused and that meetings do not drag on unnecessarily. The Scrum Master is responsible for enforcing the time-boxed meetings, making sure that they start and end on time and that the team stays on track during the meeting. This helps to ensure that the team has enough time to complete all of the necessary work during a Sprint and that they are able to keep up with the pace of the development effort.

In addition, the Scrum Master is responsible for coaching people on Scrum values. These values, which include transparency, inspection, and adaptation, are core to the Scrum framework and are essential for the team to be successful. The Scrum Master helps to reinforce these values by coaching team members on how to apply them in their work and by providing guidance on how to make improvements. The Scrum Master also helps to ensure that the team members are following the values by observing their behavior during meetings and other activities and providing feedback as necessary.

Overall, the Scrum Master plays a critical role in ensuring that the Scrum framework is followed and that the team is continuously improving. By facilitating time-boxed meetings and coaching people on Scrum values, the Scrum Master helps to ensure that the team is able to work effectively and efficiently, deliver high-quality products, and continuously improve their processes.

==== Question 3

****

How might a Scrum Master help the Scrum Team resolve an internal disagreement, which is causing inter-personal conflicts, regarding how to troubleshoot and diagnose a difficult, ongoing production bug that must be fixed as part of the current Sprint's Definition of Done?

* [ ] Involve the complete Development Team in forming a decision that is in line with the Scrum Values.
* [ ] Use coaching and facilitation techniques, such as open questions and active listening.
* [ ] Ask an external specialist on the production team to determine the most sensible path forward.
* [ ] Incorporate the Human Resources department to help resolve any inter-personal conflicts that have arisen.


****

Options A and B are correct.

A Scrum Team is expected to be cross-functional and have all the skills needed to address the issues that arise. The team should be able to make decisions without consulting external specialists.

A self-managed, cross-functional team is also expected to resolve conflicts on their own. From the Scrum perspective, and certainly on the Scrum Master certification exam, going to Human Resources to resolve a problem is not the prescribed approach. The Scrum Guide never even mentions the term "Human Resources.'

A Scrum Master coaches and facilitates in order to help the development team come to their own conclusions and paths forward.

==== Question 4

****

You're the Scrum Master and you've run into a problem with your team.

- Developers think Retrospectives are not productive
- Developers do not want to attend Retrospectives anymore

How should the Scrum Master respond?


* [ ] Bring human resources in to talk to the developers about their roles and responsibilities.
* [ ] Respect the decision of the self-managed and self-organized team and skip the Sprint Retrospectives.
* [ ] Consult the Product Owner, as they have final say over whether a Sprint Retrospective needs to be done
* [ ] Educate the team on how Sprint Retrospectives help reinforce Scrum values, and help to facilitate more productive Retrospectives.


****

Option D is correct.

As a certified Scrum Master, it's important to recognize that the Sprint Retrospective is a critical ceremony in the Scrum framework. The retrospective provides the team with an opportunity to reflect on their work during the previous sprint, identify areas for improvement, and make adjustments to their process for the next sprint.

If developers want to cancel the Sprint Retrospective, it's important to understand their reasoning and address their concerns. Here are some steps that a Scrum Master could take:

Understand the reasons: The Scrum Master should have a conversation with the developers to understand why they want to cancel the Sprint Retrospective. There may be valid concerns or issues that the team needs to address.

Educate the team: The Scrum Master should educate the team on the importance of the Sprint Retrospective and the benefits that can come from holding the ceremony. The Scrum Master can explain that canceling the retrospective could lead to missed opportunities for process improvement and may negatively impact team morale.

Identify alternative solutions: The Scrum Master can work with the team to identify alternative solutions that address their concerns while still allowing the team to hold the retrospective. For example, if the developers feel that the retrospectives are taking too much time, the team could try shortening the retrospective or adjusting the format to make it more efficient.

Scrum is immutable. That means it must be done in its entirety or not done at all. Sprint Retrospectives cannot be cancelled if you want to describe what you are doing as Scrum.

==== Question 5

****
What should a Scrum Master do if the Development Team is missing the necessary skills, tools and infrastructure needed to complete the highest priority backlog items?

(Choose 2)

* [ ] Coach the Development Team on how to spend time during the sprint learning and improving their skills and acquiring tools they will need to complete important backlog items.
* [ ] Encourage the Product Owner to accept partially Done increments.
* [ ] Declare the current Sprint an 'infrastructure Sprint' and focus on improving the Development Team's skills and acquiring the necessary tools instead of delivering an increment.
* [ ] Dissolve the Sprint and inform management that the Development Team is not ready for Scrum.
* [ ] Help to establish a Definition of Done for backlog items that is achievable given the current infrastructure and skillsets.

****

The Scrum Developers are expected to have all of the skills required to complete all the Product Backlog items. If those skills do not exist, the developers must acquire them as they work on other Product Backlog items.

One way to continue to complete Backlog Items while infrastructure or tools are lacking might be to adjust the Definition of Done so that Sprint Goals can be achieved.

Every Sprint must provide a real, tangible increment of work. There are no 'infrastructure sprints' in Scrum or 'Sprint Zeros.' Every Sprint must have the delivery of an increment of work as its goal.
