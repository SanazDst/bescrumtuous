The Scrum Guide is held at the exact same time and in the exact same location every day.It is true that the Product Owner and Scrum Master are not allowed to participate, but this is not in order to reduce complexity."The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute event for the Developers of the Scrum Team. To reduce complexity, it is held at the same time and place every working day of the Sprint." -TSG, page 9
