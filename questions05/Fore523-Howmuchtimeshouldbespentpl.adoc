For a month long sprint the Scrum Guide states that Sprint Planning should take no more than 8 hours. For a 2 week sprint, the amount of time spent sprint-planning should be significantly shorter.From the Scrum Guide: "Sprint Planning is timeboxed to a maximum of eight hours for a one-month Sprint. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter."
