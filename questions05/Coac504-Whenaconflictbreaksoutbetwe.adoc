Conflicts are always a challenge to deal with, regardless of whether you are a developer, Scrum Master or Product Owner.When a conflict does arise, try to involve the entire Scrum Team in decision making, and use active and empathetic listening techniques to try and hear each party's point of view and facilitate a resolution.
