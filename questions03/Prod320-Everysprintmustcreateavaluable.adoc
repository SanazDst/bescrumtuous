According to the Scrum Guide, "the entire Scrum Team is accountable for creating a valuable, useful Increment every Sprint."The Scrum Guide doesn't actually use the term iteration.Not every item in the Sprint Backlog gets completed in a Sprint. Anything left unfinished at the end of the Sprint goes back into the Product Backlog to potentially be added into the next Sprint.
