If team members are not communicating effectively, they need to be coached on Scrum Values and the importance of working as a team.This is also an issue to bring up at the Sprint Retrospective. Any time there are communication issues that were not resolved during the Sprint, the Sprint Retrospective is the correct time to discuss them.
