[#explanation]

A Burndown Chart shows the amount of work done and the amount of work remaining.This was mentioned in older Scrum Guides but not the new one. There is a chance you might see a reference to a Burndown Chart on the exam.References to points or velocity are unlikely to be the correct answer on the PSMI exam.
